About the eBook
The Salinas Valley is in Northern California It is a long narrow swale between two ranges of
mountains and the Salinas River winds and twists up the center until it falls at last into Monterey
Bay
I remember my childhood names for grasses and secret flowers I remember where a toad may
live and what time the birds awaken in the summerand what trees and seasons smelled like
how people looked and walked and smelled even The memory of odors is very rich
I remember that the Gabilan Mountains to the east of the valley were light gay mountains full of
sun and loveliness and a kind of invitation so that you wanted to climb into their warm foothills
almost as you want to climb into the lap of a beloved mother They were beckoning mountains
with a brown grass love The Santa Lucias stood up against the sky to the west and kept the
valley from the open sea and they were dark and broodingunfriendly and dangerous I always
found in myself a dread of west and a love of east Where I ever got such an idea I cannot say
unless it could be that the morning came over the peaks of the Gabilans and the night drifted back
from the ridges of the Santa Lucias It may be that the birth and death of the day had some part in
my feeling about the two ranges of mountains
From both sides of the valley little streams slipped out of the hill canyons and fell into the bed of
the Salinas River In the winter of wet years the streams ran fullfreshet and they swelled the
river until sometimes it raged and boiled bank full and then it was a destroyer The river tore
the edges of the farm lands and washed whole acres down it toppled barns and houses into itself
to go floating and bobbing away It trapped cows and pigs and sheep and drowned them in its
muddy brown water and carried them to the sea Then when the late spring came the river drew
in from its edges and the sand banks appeared And in the summer the river didnt run at all
above ground Some pools would be left in the deep swirl places under a high bank The tules and
grasses grew back and willows straightened up with the flood debris in their upper branches
The Salinas was only a parttime river The summer sun drove it underground It was not a fine
river at all but it was the only one we had and so we boasted about ithow dangerous it was in a
wet winter and how dry it was in a dry summer You can boast about anything if its all you have
Maybe the less you have the more you are reuired to boast
The floor of the Salinas Valley between the ranges and below the foothills is level because this
valley used to be the bottom of a hundredmile inlet from the sea The river mouth at Moss
Landing was centuries ago the entrance to this long inland water Once fifty miles down the
valley my father bored a well The drill came up first with topsoil and then with gravel and then
with white sea sand full of shells and even pieces of whalebone There were twenty feet of sand
and then black earth again and even a piece of redwood that imperishable wood that does not
rot Before the inland sea the valley must have been a forest And those things had happened right
under our feet And it seemed to me sometimes at night that I could feel both the sea and the
redwood forest before it
On the wide level acres of the valley the topsoil lay deep and fertile It reuired only a rich winter
of rain to make it break forth in grass and flowers The spring flowers in a wet year were
unbelievable The whole valley floor and the foothills too would be carpeted with lupins and
poppies Once a woman told me that colored flowers would seem more bright if you added a few
white flowers to give the colors definition Every petal of blue lupin is edged with white so that a
field of lurins is more blue than you can imagine And mixed with these were splashes of
California poppies These too are of a burning colornot orange not gold but if pure gold were
liuid and could raise a cream that golden cream might be like the color of the poppies When
their season was over the yellow mustard came up and grew to a great height When my
grandfather came into the valley the mustard was so tall that a man on horseback showed only his
head above the yellow flowers On the uplands the grass would be strewn with buttercups with
henandchickens with blackcentered yellow violets And a little later in the season there would
be red and yellow stands of Indian paintbrush These were the flowers of the open places exposed
to the sun
Under the live oaks shaded and dusky the maidenhair flourished and gave a good smell and
under the mossy banks of the water courses whole clumps of fivefingered ferns and goldybacks
hung down Then there were harebells tiny lanterns cream white and almost sinful looking and
these were so rare and magical that a child finding one felt singled out and special all day long
When June came the grasses headed out and turned brown and the hills turned a brown which
was not brown but a gold and saffron and redan indescribable color And from then on until
the next rains the earth dried and the streams stopped Cracks appeared on the level ground The
Salinas River sank under its sand The wind blew down the valley picking up dust and straws
and grew stronger and harsher as it went south It stopped in the evening It was a rasping nervous
wind and the dust particles cut into a mans skin and burned his eyes Men working in the fields
wore goggles and tied handkerchiefs around their noses to keep the dirt out
The valley land was deep and rich but the foothills wore only a skin of topsoil no deeper than the
grass roots and the farther up the hills you went the thinner grew the soil with flints sticking
through until at the brush line it was a kind of dry flinty gravel that reflected the hot sun
blindingly
I have spoken of the rich years when the rainfall was plentiful But there were dry years too and
they put a terror on the valley The water came in a thirtyyear cycle There would be five or six
wet and wonderful years when there might be nineteen to twentyfive inches of rain and the
land would shout with grass Then would come six or seven pretty good years of twelve to
sixteen inches of rain And then the dry years would come and sometimes there would be only
seven or eight inches of rain The land dried up and the grasses headed out miserably a few
inches high and great bare scabby places appeared in the valley The live oaks got a crusty look
and the sagebrush was gray The land cracked and the springs dried up and the cattle listlessly
nibbled dry twigs Then the farmers and the ranchers would be filled with disgust for the Salinas
Valley The cows would grow thin and sometimes starve to death People would have to haul
water in barrels to their farms just for drinking Some families would sell out for nearly nothing
and move away And it never failed that during the dry years the people forgot about the rich
years and during the wet years they lost all memory of the dry years It was always that way
And that was the long Salinas Valley Its history was like that of the rest of the state First there
were Indians an inferior breed without energy inventiveness or culture a people that lived on
grubs and grasshoppers and shellfish too lazy to hunt or fish They ate what they could pick up
and planted nothing They pounded bitter acorns for flour Even their warfare was a weary
pantomime
Then the hard dry Spaniards came exploring through greedy and realistic and their greed was
for gold or God They collected souls as they collected jewels They gathered mountains and
valleys rivers and whole horizons the way a man might now gain title to building lots These
tough driedup men moved restlessly up the coast and down Some of them stayed on grants as
large as principalities given to them by Spanish kings who had not the faintest idea of the gift
These first owners lived in poor feudal settlements and their cattle ranged freely and multiplied
Periodically the owners killed the cattle for their hides and tallow and left the meat to the vultures
and coyotes
When the Spaniards came they had to give everything they saw a name This is the first duty of
any explorera duty and a privilege You must name a thing before you can note it on your hand
drawn map Of course they were religious people and the men who could read and write who
kept the records and drew the maps were the tough untiring priests who traveled with the
soldiers Thus the first names of places were saints names or religious holidays celebrated at
stopping places There are many saints but they are not inexhaustible so that we find repetitions
in the first namings We have San Miguel St Michael San Ardo San Bernardo San Benito San
Lorenzo San Carlos San Francisuito And then the holidaysNatividad the Nativity
Nacimiente the Birth Soledad the Solitude But places were also named from the way the
expedition felt at the time Buena Esperenza good hope Buena Vista because the view was
beautiful and Chualar because it was pretty The descriptive names followed Paso de los Robles
because of the oak trees Los Laureles for the laurels Tularcitos because of the reeds in the
swamp and Salinas for the alkali which was white as salt
Then places were named for animals and birds seenGabilanes for the hawks which flew in
those mountains Topo for the mole Los Gatos for the wild cats The suggestions sometimes
came from the nature of the place itself Tassajara a cup and saucer Laguna Seca a dry lake
Corral de Tierra for a fence of earth Paraiso because it was like Heaven
Then the Americans camemore greedy because there were more of them They took the lands
remade the laws to make their titles good And farmholds spread over the land first in the valleys
and then up the foothill slopes small wooden houses roofed with redwood shakes corrals of
split poles Wherever a trickle of water came out of the ground a house sprang up and a family
began to grow and multiply Cuttings of red geraniums and rosebushes were planted in the
dooryards Wheel tracks of buckboards replaced the trails and fields of corn and barley and
wheat suared out of the yellow mustard Every ten miles along the traveled routes a general
store and blacksmith shop happened and these became the nuclei of little towns Bradley King
City Greenfield
The Americans had a greater tendency to name places for people than had the Spanish After the
valleys were settled the names of places refer more to things which happened there and these to
me are the most fascinating of all names because each name suggests a story that has been
forgotten I think of Bolsa Nueva a new purse Morocojo a lame Moor who was he and how did
he get there Wild Horse Canyon and Mustang Grade and Shirt Tail Canyon The names of
places carry a charge of the people who named them reverent or irreverent descriptive either
poetic or disparaging You can name anything San Lorenzo but Shirt Tail Canyon or the Lame
Moor is something uite different
The wind whistled over the settlements in the afternoon and the farmers began to set out mile
long windbreaks of eucalyptus to keep the plowed topsoil from blowing away And this is about
the way the Salinas Valley was when my grandfather brought his wife and settled in the foothills
to the east of King City
I must depend on hearsay on old photographs on stories told and on memories which are hazy
and mixed with fable in trying to tell you about the Hamiltons They were not eminent people
and there are few records concerning them except for the usual papers on birth marriage land
ownership and death
Young Samuel Hamilton came from the north of Ireland and so did his wife He was the son of
small farmers neither rich nor poor who had lived on one landhold and in one stone house for
many hundreds of years The Hamiltons managed to be remarkably well educated and well read
and as is so often true in that green country they were connected and related to very great people
and very small people so that one cousin might be a baronet and another cousin a beggar And of
course they were descended from the ancient kings of Ireland as every Irishman is
Why Samuel left the stone house and the green acres of his ancestors I do not know He was
never a political man so it is not likely a charge of rebellion drove him out and he was
scrupulously honest which eliminates the police as prime movers There was a whispernot
even a rumor but rather an unsaid feelingin my family that it was love drove him out and not
love of the wife he married But whether it was too successful love or whether he left in piue at
unsuccessful love I do not know We always preferred to think it was the former Samuel had
good looks and charm and gaiety It is hard to imagine that any country Irish girl refused him
He came to the Salinas Valley fullblown and hearty full of inventions and energy His eyes were
very blue and when he was tired one of them wandered outward a little He was a big man but
delicate in a way In the dusty business of ranching he seemed always immaculate His hands
were clever He was a good blacksmith and carpenter and woodcarver and he could improvise
anything with bits of wood and metal He was forever inventing a new way of doing an old thing
and doing it better and uicker but he never in his whole life had any talent for making money
Other men who had the talent took Samuels tricks and sold them and grew rich but Samuel
barely made wages all his life
I dont know what directed his steps toward the Salinas Valley It was an unlikely place for a man
from a green country to come to but he came about thirty years before the turn of the century and
he brought with him his tiny Irish wife a tight hard little woman humorless as a chicken She had
a dour Presbyterian mind and a code of morals that pinned down and beat the brains out of nearly
everything that was pleasant to do
I do not know where Samuel met her how he wooed her married I think there must have been
some other girl printed somewhere in his heart for he was a man of love and his wife was not a
woman to show her feelings And in spite of this in all the years from his youth to his death in
the Salinas Valley there was no hint that Samuel ever went to any other woman
When Samuel and Liza came to the Salinas Valley all the level land was taken the rich bottoms
the little fertile creases in the hills the forests but there was still marginal land to be
homesteaded and in the barren hills to the east of what is now King City Samuel Hamilton
homesteaded
He followed the usual practice He took a uartersection for himself and a uartersection for his
wife and since she was pregnant he took a uartersection for the child Over the years nine
children were born four boys and five girls and with each birth another uartersection was
added to the ranch and that makes eleven uartersections or seventeen hundred and sixty acres
If the land had been any good the Hamiltons would have been rich people But the acres were
harsh and dry There were no springs and the crust of topsoil was so thin that the flinty bones
stuck through Even the sagebrush struggled to exist and the oaks were dwarfed from lack of
moisture Even in reasonably good years there was so little feed that the cattle kept thin running
about looking for enough to eat From their barren hills the Hamiltons could look down to the
west and see the richness of the bottom land and the greenness around the Salinas River
Samuel built his house with his own hands and he built a barn and a blacksmith shop He found
uite soon that even if he had ten thousand acres of hill country he could not make a living on the
bony soil without water His clever hands built a wellboring rig and he bored wells on the lands
of luckier men He invented and built a threshing machine and moved through the bottom farms
in harvest time threshing the grain his own farm would not raise And in his shop he sharpened
plows and mended harrows and welded broken axles and shod horses Men from all over the
district brought him tools to mend and to improve Besides they loved to hear Samuel talk of the
world and its thinking of the poetry and philosophy that were going on outside the Salinas
Valley He had a rich deep voice good both in song and in speech and while he had no brogue
there was a rise and a lilt and a cadence to his talk that made it sound sweet in the ears of the
taciturn farmers from the valley bottom They brought whisky too and out of sight of the kitchen
window and the disapproving eye of Mrs Hamilton they took hot nips from the bottle and
nibbled cuds of green wild anise to cover the whisky breath It was a bad day when three or four
men were not standing around the forge listening to Samuels hammer and his talk They called
him a comical genius and carried his stories carefully home and they wondered at how the stories
spilled out on the way for they never sounded the same repeated in their own kitchens
Samuel should have been rich from his well rig and his threshing machine and his shop but he
had no gift for business His customers always pressed for money promised payment after
harvest and then after Christmas and then afteruntil at last they forgot it Samuel had no gift
for reminding them And so the Hamiltons stayed poor
The children came along as regularly as the years The few overworked doctors of the county did
not often get to the ranches for a birth unless the joy turned nightmare and went on for several
days Samuel Hamilton delivered all his own children and tied the cords neatly spanked the
bottoms and cleaned up the mess When his youngest was born with some small obstruction and
began to turn black Samuel put his mouth against the babys mouth and blew air in and sucked it
out until the baby could take over for himself Samuels hands were so good and gentle that
neighbors from twenty miles away would call on him to help with a birth And he was eually
good with mare cow or woman
Samuel had a great black book on an available shelf and it had gold letters on the coverDr
Gunns Family Medicine Some pages were bent and beat up from use and others were never
opened to the light To look through Dr Gunn is to know the Hamiltons medical history These
are the used sectionsbroken bones cuts bruises mumps measles backache scarlet fever
diphtheria rheumatism female complaints hernia and of course everything to do with
pregnancy and the birth of children The Hamiltons must have been either lucky or moral for the
sections on gonorrhea and syphilis were never opened
Samuel had no eual for soothing hysteria and bringing uiet to a frightened child It was the
sweetness of his tongue and the tenderness of his soul And just as there was a cleanness about
his body so there was a cleanness in his thinking Men coming to his blacksmith shop to talk and
listen dropped their cursing for a while not from any kind of restraint but automatically as
though this were not the place for it
Samuel kept always a foreignness Perhaps it was in the cadence of his speech and this had the
effect of making men and women too tell him things they would not tell to relatives or close
friends His slight strangeness set him apart and made him safe as a repository
Liza Hamilton was a very different kettle of Irish Her head was small and round and it held small
round convictions She had a button nose and a hard little setback chin a gripping jaw set on its
course even though the angels of God argued against it
Liza was a good plain cook and her houseit was always her housewas brushed and
pummeled and washed Bearing her children did not hold her back very muchtwo weeks at the
most she had to be careful She must have had a pelvic arch of whalebone for she had big
children one after the other
Liza had a finely developed sense of sin Idleness was a sin and card playing which was a kind
of idleness to her She was suspicious of fun whether it involved dancing or singing or even
laughter She felt that people having a good time were wide open to the devil And this was a
shame for Samuel was a laughing man but I guess Samuel was wide open to the devil His wife
protected him whenever she could
She wore her hair always pulled tight back and bunned behind in a hard knot And since I cant
remember how she dressed it must have been that she wore clothes that matched herself exactly
She had no spark of humor and only occasionally a blade of cutting wit She frightened her
grandchildren because she had no weakness She suffered bravely and uncomplainingly through
life convinced that that was the way her God wanted everyone to live She felt that rewards came
later
When people first came to the West particularly from the owned and foughtover farmlets of
Europe and saw so much land to be had for the signing of a paper and the building of a
foundation an itching landgreed seemed to come over them They wanted more and more land
good land if possible but land anyway Perhaps they had filaments of memory of feudal Europe
where great families became and remained great because they owned things The early settlers
took up land they didnt need and couldnt use they took up worthless land just to own it And all
proportions changed A man who might have been welltodo on ten acres in Europe was ratpoor
on two thousand in California
It wasnt very long until all the land in the barren hills near King City and San Ardo was taken
up and ragged families were scattered through the hills trying their best to scratch a living from
the thin flinty soil They and the coyotes lived clever despairing submarginal lives They landed
with no money no euipment no tools no credit and particularly with no knowledge of the new
country and no techniue for using it I dont know whether it was a divine stupidity or a great
faith that let them do it Surely such venture is nearly gone from the world And the families did
survive and grow They had a tool or a weapon that is also nearly gone or perhaps it is only
dormant for a while It is argued that because they believed thoroughly in a just moral God they
could put their faith there and let the smaller securities take care of themselves But I think that
because they trusted themselves and respected themselves as individuals because they knew
beyond doubt that they were valuable and potentially moral unitsbecause of this they could
give God their own courage and dignity and then receive it back Such things have disappeared
perhaps because men do not trust themselves any more and when that happens there is nothing
left except perhaps to find some strong sure man even though he may be wrong and to dangle
from his coattails
While many people came to the Salinas Valley penniless there were others who having sold out
somewhere else arrived with money to start a new life These usually bought land but good
land and built their houses of planed lumber and had carpets and coloredglass diamond panes in
their windows There were numbers of these families and they got the good land of the valley and
cleared the yellow mustard away and planted wheat
Such a man was Adam Trask
Adam Trask was born on a farm on the outskirts of a little town which was not far from a big
town in Connecticut He was an only son and he was born six months after his father was
mustered into a Connecticut regiment in  Adams mother ran the farm bore Adam and
still had time to embrace a primitive theosophy She felt that her husband would surely be killed
by the wild and barbarous rebels and she prepared herself to get in touch with him in what she
called the beyond He came home six weeks after Adam was born His right leg was off at the
knee He stumped in on a crude wooden leg he himself had carved out of beechwood And
already it was splitting He had in his pocket and placed on the parlor table the lead bullet they
had given him to bite while they cut off his frayed leg
Adams father Cyrus was something of a devilhad always been wilddrove a twowheeled
cart too fast and managed to make his wooden leg seem jaunty and desirable He had enjoyed his
military career what there was of it Being wild by nature he had liked his brief period of
training and the drinking and gambling and whoring that went with it Then he marched south
with a group of replacements and he enjoyed that tooseeing the country and stealing chickens
and chasing rebel girls up into the haystacks The gray despairing weariness of protracted
maneuvers and combat did not touch him The first time he saw the enemy was at eight oclock
one spring morning and at eightthirty he was hit in the right leg by a heavy slug that mashed and
splintered the bones beyond repair Even then he was lucky for the rebels retreated and the field
surgeons moved up immediately Cyrus Trask did have his five minutes of horror while they cut
the shreds away and sawed the bone off suare and burned the open flesh The toothmarks in the
bullet proved that And there was considerable pain while the wound healed under the unusually
septic conditions in the hospitals of that day But Cyrus had vitality and swagger While he was
carving his beechwood leg and hobbling about on a crutch he contracted a particularly virulent
dose of the clap from a Negro girl who whistled at him from under a pile of lumber and charged
him ten cents When he had his new leg and painfully knew his condition he hobbled about for
days looking for the girl He told his bunkmates what he was going to do when he found her He
planned to cut off her ears and her nose with his pocketknife and get his money back Carving on
his wooden leg he showed his friends how he would cut her When I finish her shell be a funny
looking bitch he said Ill make her so a drunk Indian wont take out after her His light of
love must have sensed his intentions for he never found her By the time Cyrus was released
from the hospital and the army his gonorrhea was dried up When he got home to Connecticut
there remained only enough of it for his wife
Mrs Trask was a pale insideherself woman No heat of sun ever reddened her cheeks and no
open laughter raised the corners of her mouth She used religion as a therapy for the ills of the
world and of herself and she changed the religion to fit the ill When she found that the
theosophy she had developed for communication with a dead husband was not necessary she
cast about for some new unhappiness Her search was uickly rewarded by the infection Cyrus
brought home from the war And as soon as she was aware that a condition existed she devised a
new theology Her god of communication became a god of vengeanceto her the most
satisfactory deity she had devised so farand as it turned out the last It was uite easy for her
to attribute her condition to certain dreams she had experienced while her husband was away But
the disease was not punishment enough for her nocturnal philandering Her new god was an
expert in punishment He demanded of her a sacrifice She searched her mind for some proper
egotistical humility and almost happily arrived at the sacrificeherself It took her two weeks to
write her last letter with revisions and corrected spelling In it she confessed to crimes she could
not possibly have committed and admitted faults far beyond her capacity And then dressed in a
secretly made shroud she went out on a moonlight night and drowned herself in a pond so
shallow that she had to get down on her knees in the mud and hold her head under water This
reuired great will power As the warm unconsciousness finally crept over her she was thinking
with some irritation of how her white lawn shroud would have mud down the front when they
pulled her out in the morning And it did
Cyrus Trask mourned for his wife with a keg of whisky and three old army friends who had
dropped in on their way home to Maine Baby Adam cried a good deal at the beginning of the
wake for the mourners not knowing about babies had neglected to feed him Cyrus soon solved
the problem He dipped a rag in whisky and gave it to the baby to suck and after three or four
dippings young Adam went to sleep Several times during the mourning period he awakened and
complained and got the dipped rag again and went to sleep The baby was drunk for two days and
a half Whatever may have happened in his developing brain it proved beneficial to his
metabolism from that two and a half days he gained an iron health And when at the end of three
days his father finally went out and bought a goat Adam drank the milk greedily vomited drank
more and was on his way His father did not find the reaction alarming since he was doing the
same thing
Within a month Cyrus Trasks choice fell on the seventeenyearold daughter of a neighboring
farmer The courtship was uick and realistic There was no doubt in anybodys mind about his
intentions They were honorable and reasonable Her father abetted the courtship He had two
younger daughters and Alice the eldest was seventeen This was her first proposal
Cyrus wanted a woman to take care of Adam He needed someone to keep house and cook and a
servant cost money He was a vigorous man and needed the body of a woman and that too cost
moneyunless you were married to it Within two weeks Cyrus had wooed wedded bedded
and impregnated her His neighbors did not find his action hasty It was uite normal in that day
for a man to use up three or four wives in a normal lifetime
Alice Trask had a number of admirable ualities She was a deep scrubber and a cornercleaner in
the house She was not very pretty so there was no need to watch her Her eyes were pale her
complexion sallow and her teeth crooked but she was extremely healthy and never complained
during her pregnancy Whether she liked children or not no one ever knew She was not asked
and she never said anything unless she was asked From Cyruss point of view this was possibly
the greatest of her virtues She never offered any opinion or statement and when a man was
talking she gave a vague impression of listening while she went about doing the housework
The youth inexperience and taciturnity of Alice Trask all turned out to be assets for Cyrus
While he continued to operate his farm as such farms were operated in the neighborhood he
entered on a new careerthat of the old soldier And that energy which had made him wild now
made him thoughtful No one now outside of the War Department knew the uality and duration
of his service His wooden leg was at once a certificate of proof of his soldiering and a guarantee
that he wouldnt ever have to do it again Timidly he began to tell Alice about his campaigns but
as his techniue grew so did his battles At the very first he knew he was lying but it was not
long before he was eually sure that every one of his stories was true Before he had entered the
service he had not been much interested in warfare now he bought every book about war read
every report subscribed to the New York papers studied maps His knowledge of geography
had been shaky and his information about the fighting nonexistent now he became an authority
He knew not only the battles movements campaigns but also the units involved down to the
regiments their colonels and where they originated And from telling he became convinced that
he had been there
All of this was a gradual development and it took place while Adam was growing to boyhood
and his young halfbrother behind him Adam and little Charles would sit silent and respectful
while their father explained how every general thought and planned and where they had made
their mistakes and what they should have done And thenhe had known it at the timehe had
told Grant and McClellan where they were wrong and had begged them to take his analysis of the
situation Invariably they refused his advice and only afterward was he proved right
There was one thing Cyrus did not do and perhaps it was clever of him He never once promoted
himself to noncommissioned rank Private Trask he began and Private Trask he remained In the
total telling it made him at once the most mobile and ubiuitous private in the history of warfare
It made it necessary for him to be in as many as four places at once But perhaps instinctively he
did not tell those stories close to each other Alice and the boys had a complete picture of him a
private soldier and proud of it who not only happened to be where every spectacular and
important action was taking place but who wandered freely into staff meetings and joined or
dissented in the decisions of general officers
The death of Lincoln caught Cyrus in the pit of the stomach Always he remembered how he felt
when he first heard the news And he could never mention it or hear of it without uick tears in
his eyes And while he never actually said it you got the indestructible impression that Private
Cyrus Trask was one of Lincolns closest warmest and most trusted friends When Mr Lincoln
wanted to know about the army the real army not those prancing dummies in gold braid he
turned to Private Trask How Cyrus managed to make this understood without saying it was a
triumph of insinuation No one could call him a liar And this was mainly because the lie was in
his head and any truth coming from his mouth carried the color of the lie
uite early he began to write letters and then articles about the conduct of the war and his
conclusions were intelligent and convincing Indeed Cyrus developed an excellent military mind
His criticisms both of the war as it had been conducted and of the army organization as it
persisted were irresistibly penetrating His articles in various magazines attracted attention His
letters to the War Department printed simultaneously in the newspapers began to have a sharp
effect in decisions on the army Perhaps if the Grand Army of the Republic had not assumed
political force and direction his voice might not have been heard so clearly in Washington but
the spokesman for a block of nearly a million men was not to be ignored And such a voice in
military matters Cyrus Trask became It came about that he was consulted in matters of army
organization in officer relationships in personnel and euipment His expertness was apparent to
everyone who heard him He had a genius for the military More than that he was one of those
responsible for the organization of the GAR as a cohesive and potent force in the national life
After several unpaid offices in that organization he took a paid secretaryship which he kept for
the rest of his life He traveled from one end of the country to the other attending conventions
meetings and encampments So much for his public life
His private life was also laced through with his new profession He was a man devoted His house
and farm he organized on a military basis He demanded and got reports on the conduct of his
private economy It is probable that Alice preferred it this way She was not a talker A terse
report was easiest for her She was busy with the growing boys and with keeping the house clean
and the clothes washed Also she had to conserve her energy though she did not mention this in
any of her reports Without warning her energy would leave her and she would have to sit down
and wait until it came back In the night she would be drenched with perspiration She knew
perfectly well that she had what was called consumption would have known even if she was not
reminded by a hard exhausting cough And she did not know how long she would live Some
people wasted on for uite a few years There wasnt any rule about it Perhaps she didnt dare to
mention it to her husband He had devised a method for dealing with sickness which resembled
punishment A stomach ache was treated with a purge so violent that it was a wonder anyone
survived it If she had mentioned her condition Cyrus might have started a treatment which
would have killed her off before her consumption could have done it Besides as Cyrus became
more military his wife learned the only techniue through which a soldier can survive She never
made herself noticeable never spoke unless spoken to performed what was expected and no
more and tried for no promotions She became a rear rank private It was much easier that way
Alice retired to the background until she was barely visible at all
It was the little boys who really caught it Cyrus had decided that even though the army was not
perfect it was still the only honorable profession for a man He mourned the fact that he could
not be a permanent soldier because of his wooden leg but he could not imagine any career for his
sons except the army He felt a man should learn soldiering from the ranks as he had Then he
would know what it was about from experience not from charts and textbooks He taught them
the manual of arms when they could barely walk By the time they were in grade school close
order drill was as natural as breathing and as hateful as hell He kept them hard with exercises
beating out the rhythm with a stick on his wooden leg He made them walk for miles carrying
knapsacks loaded with stones to make their shoulders strong He worked constantly on their
marksmanship in the woodlot behind the house
When a child first catches adults outwhen it first walks into his grave little head that adults do
not have divine intelligence that their judgments are not always wise their thinking true their
sentences justhis world falls into panic desolation The gods are fallen and all safety gone And
there is one sure thing about the fall of gods they do not fall a little they crash and shatter or sink
deeply into green muck It is a tedious job to build them up again they never uite shine And the
childs world is never uite whole again It is an aching kind of growing
Adam found his father out It wasnt that his father changed but that some new uality came to
Adam He had always hated the discipline as every normal animal does but it was just and true
and inevitable as measles not to be denied or cursed only to be hated And thenit was very
fast almost a click in the brainAdam knew that for him at least his fathers methods had no
reference to anything in the world but his father The techniues and training were not designed
for the boys at all but only to make Cyrus a great man And the same click in the brain told Adam
that his father was not a great man that he was indeed a very strongwilled and concentrated
little man wearing a huge busby Who knows what causes thisa look in the eye a lie found out
a moment of hesitationthen god comes crashing down in a childs brain
Young Adam was always an obedient child Something in him shrank from violence from
contention from the silent shrieking tensions that can rip at a house He contributed to the uiet
he wished for by offering no violence no contention and to do this he had to retire into
secretness since there is some violence in everyone He covered his life with a veil of
vagueness while behind his uiet eyes a rich full life went on This did not protect him from
assault but it allowed him an immunity
His halfbrother Charles only a little over a year younger grew up with his fathers assertiveness
Charles was a natural athlete with instinctive timing and coordination and the competitors will
to win over others which makes for success in the world
Young Charles won all contests with Adam whether they involved skill or strength or uick
intelligence and won them so easily that uite early he lost interest and had to find his
competition among other children Thus it came about that a kind of affection grew up between
the two boys but it was more like an association between brother and sister than between
brothers Charles fought any boy who challenged or slurred Adam and usually won He protected
Adam from his fathers harshness with lies and even with blametaking Charles felt for his
brother the affection one has for helpless things for blind puppies and new babies
Adam looked out of his covered brainout the long tunnels of his eyesat the people of his
world His father a onelegged natural force at first installed justly to make little boys feel littler
and stupid boys aware of their stupidity and thenafter god had crashedhe saw his father as
the policeman laid on by birth the officer who might be circumvented or fooled but never
challenged And out of the long tunnels of his eyes Adam saw his halfbrother Charles as a bright
being of another species gifted with muscle and bone speed and alertness uite on a different
plane to be admired as one admires the sleek lazy danger of a black leopard not by any chance
to be compared with ones self And it would no more have occurred to Adam to confide in his
brotherto tell him the hunger the gray dreams the plans and silent pleasures that lay at the
back of the tunneled eyesthan to share his thoughts with a lovely tree or a pheasant in flight
Adam was glad of Charles the way a woman is glad of a fat diamond and he depended on his
brother in the way that same woman depends on the diamonds glitter and the selfsecurity tied
up in its worth but love affection empathy were beyond conception
Toward Alice Trask Adam concealed a feeling that was akin to a warm shame She was not his
motherthat he knew because he had been told many times Not from things said but from the
tone in which other things were said he knew that he had once had a mother and that she had
done some shameful thing such as forgetting the chickens or missing the target on the range in
the woodlot And as a result of her fault she was not here Adam thought sometimes that if he
could only find out what sin it was she had committed why he would sin it tooand not be here
Alice treated the boys eually washed them and fed them and left everything else to their father
who had let it be known clearly and with finality that training the boys physically and mentally
was his exclusive province Even praise and reprimand he would not delegate Alice never
complained uarreled laughed or cried Her mouth was trained to a line that concealed nothing
and offered nothing too But once when Adam was uite small he wandered silently into the
kitchen Alice did not see him She was darning socks and she was smiling Adam retired secretly
and walked out of the house and into the woodlot to a sheltered place behind a stump that he
knew well He settled deep between the protecting roots Adam was as shocked as though he had
come upon her naked He breathed excitedly high against his throat For Alice had been naked
she had been smiling He wondered how she had dared such wantonness And he ached toward
her with a longing that was passionate and hot He did not know what it was about but all the
long lack of holding of rocking of caressing the hunger for breast and nipple and the softness
of a lap and the voicetone of love and compassion and the sweet feeling of anxietyall of
these were in his passion and he did not know it because he did not know that such things
existed so how could he miss them
Of course it occurred to him that he might be wrong that some misbegotten shadow had fallen
across his face and warped his seeing And so he cast back to the sharp picture in his head and
knew that the eyes were smiling too Twisted light could do one or the other but not both
He stalked her then gamewise as he had the woodchucks on the knoll when day after day he
had lain lifeless as a young stone and watched the old wary chucks bring their children out to sun
He spied on Alice hidden and from unsuspected eyecorner and it was true Sometimes when
she was alone and knew she was alone she permitted her mind to play in a garden and she
smiled And it was wonderful to see how uickly she could drive the smile to earth the way the
woodchucks holed their children
Adam concealed his treasure deep in his tunnels but he was inclined to pay for his pleasure with
something Alice began to find giftsin her sewing basket in her wornout purse under her
pillowtwo cinnamon pinks a bluebirds tailfeather half a stick of green sealing wax a stolen
handkerchief At first Alice was startled but then that passed and when she found some
unsuspected present the garden smile flashed and disappeared the way a trout crosses a knife of
sunshine in a pool She asked no uestions and made no comment
Her coughing was very bad at night so loud and disturbing that Cyrus had at last to put her in
another room or he would have got no sleep But he did visit her very oftenhopping on his one
bare foot steadying himself with hand on wall The boys could hear and feel the jar of his body
through the house as he hopped to and from Alices bed
As Adam grew he feared one thing more than any other He feared the day he would be taken and
enlisted in the army His father never let him forget that such a time would come He spoke of it
often It was Adam who needed the army to make a man of him Charles was pretty near a man
already And Charles was a man and a dangerous man even at fifteen and when Adam was
sixteen
The affection between the two boys had grown with the years It may be that part of Charles
feeling was contempt but it was a protective contempt It happened that one evening the boys
were playing peewee a new game to them in the dooryard A small pointed stick was laid on the
ground then struck near one end with a bat The small stick flew into the air and then was batted
as far as possible
Adam was not good at games But by some accident of eye and timing he beat his brother at
peewee Four times he drove the peewee farther than Charles did It was a new experience to him
and a wild flush came over him so that he did not watch and feel out his brothers mood as he
usually did The fifth time he drove the peewee it flew humming like a bee far out in the field He
turned happily to face Charles and suddenly he froze deep in his chest The hatred in Charles
face frightened him I guess it was just an accident he said lamely I bet I couldnt do it again
Charles set his peewee struck it and as it rose into the air swung at it and missed Charles
moved slowly toward Adam his eyes cold and noncommittal Adam edged away in terror He did
not dare to turn and run for his brother could outrun him He backed slowly away his eyes
frightened and his throat dry Charles moved close and struck him in the face with his bat Adam
covered his bleeding nose with his hands and Charles swung his bat and hit him in the ribs
knocked the wind out of him swung at his head and knocked him out And as Adam lay
unconscious on the ground Charles kicked him heavily in the stomach and walked away
After a while Adam became conscious He breathed shallowly because his chest hurt He tried to
sit up and fell back at the wrench of the torn muscles over his stomach He saw Alice looking out
and there was something in her face that he had never seen before He did not know what it was
but it was not soft or weak and it might be hatred She saw that he was looking at her dropped
the curtains into place and disappeared When Adam finally got up from the ground and moved
bent over into the kitchen he found a basin of hot water standing ready for him and a clean towel
beside it He could hear his stepmother coughing in her room
Charles had one great uality He was never sorryever He never mentioned the beating
apparently never thought of it again But Adam made very sure that he didnt win againat
anything He had always felt the danger in his brother but now he understood that he must never
win unless he was prepared to kill Charles Charles was not sorry He had very simply fulfilled
himself
Charles did not tell his father about the beating and Adam did not and surely Alice did not and
yet he seemed to know In the months that followed he turned a gentleness on Adam His speech
became softer toward him He did not punish him any more Almost nightly he lectured him but
not violently And Adam was more afraid of the gentleness than he had been at the violence for it
seemed to him that he was being trained as a sacrifice almost as though he was being subjected
to kindness before death the way victims intended to the gods were cuddled and flattered so that
they might go happily to the stone and not outrage the gods with unhappiness
Cyrus explained softly to Adam the nature of a soldier And though his knowledge came from
research rather than experience he knew and he was accurate He told his son of the sad dignity
that can belong to a soldier how he is necessary in the light of all the failures of manthe
penalty of our frailties Perhaps Cyrus discovered these things in himself as he told them It was
very different from the flagwaving shouting bellicosity of his younger days The humilities are
piled on a soldier so Cyrus said in order that he may when the time comes be not too resentful
of the final humilitya meaningless and dirty death And Cyrus talked to Adam alone and did
not permit Charles to listen
Cyrus took Adam to walk with him one late afternoon and the black conclusions of all of his
study and his thinking came out and flowed with a kind of thick terror over his son He said Ill
have you know that a soldier is the most holy of all humans because he is the most testedmost
tested of all Ill try to tell you Look nowin all of history men have been taught that killing of
men is an evil thing not to be countenanced Any man who kills must be destroyed because this is
a great sin maybe the worst sin we know And then we take a soldier and put murder in his hands
and we say to him Use it well use it wisely We put no checks on him Go out and kill as many
of a certain kind or classification of your brothers as you can And we will reward you for it
because it is a violation of your early training
Adam wet his dry lips and tried to ask and failed and tried again Why do they have to do it he
said Why is it
Cyrus was deeply moved and he spoke as he had never spoken before I dont know he said
Ive studied and maybe learned how things are but Im not even close to why they are And you
must not expect to find that people understand what they do So many things are done
instinctively the way a bee makes honey or a fox dips his paws in a stream to fool dogs A fox
cant say why he does it and what bee remembers winter or expects it to come again When I
knew you had to go I thought to leave the future open so you could dig out your own findings
and then it seemed better if I could protect you with the little I know Youll go in soon now
youve come to the age
I dont want to said Adam uickly
Youll go in soon his father went on not hearing And I want to tell you so you wont be
surprised Theyll first strip off your clothes but theyll go deeper than that Theyll shuck off
any little dignity you haveyoull lose what you think of as your decent right to live and to be let
alone to live Theyll make you live and eat and sleep and shit close to other men And when they
dress you up again youll not be able to tell yourself from the others You cant even wear a scrap
or pin a note on your breast to say This is meseparate from the rest
I dont want to do it said Adam
After a while said Cyrus youll think no thought the others do not think Youll know no
word the others cant say And youll do things because the others do them Youll feel the
danger in any difference whatevera danger to the whole crowd of likethinking likeacting
men
What if I dont Adam demanded
Yes said Cyrus sometimes that happens Once in a while there is a man who wont do what
is demanded of him and do you know what happens The whole machine devotes itself coldly to
the destruction of his difference Theyll beat your spirit and your nerves your body and your
mind with iron rods until the dangerous difference goes out of you And if you cant finally give
in theyll vomit you up and leave you stinking outsideneither part of themselves nor yet free
Its better to fall in with them They only do it to protect themselves A thing so triumphantly
illogical so beautifully senseless as an army cant allow a uestion to weaken it Within itself if
you do not hold it up to other things for comparison and derision youll find slowly surely a
reason and a logic and a kind of dreadful beauty A man who can accept it is not a worse man
always and sometimes is a much better man Pay good heed to me for I have thought long about
it Some men there are who go down the dismal wrack of soldiering surrender themselves and
become faceless But these had not much face to start with And maybe youre like that But there
are others who go down submerge in the common slough and then rise more themselves than
they were becausebecause they have lost a littleness of vanity and have gained all the gold of
the company and the regiment If you can go down so low you will be able to rise higher than
you can conceive and you will know a holy joy a companionship almost like that of a heavenly
company of angels Then you will know the uality of men even if they are inarticulate But until
you have gone way down you can never know this
As they walked back toward the house Cyrus turned left and entered the woodlot among the trees
and it was dusk Suddenly Adam said You see that stump there sir I used to hide between the
roots on the far side After you punished me I used to hide there and sometimes I went there just
because I felt bad
Lets go and see the place his father said Adam led him to it and Cyrus looked down at the
nestlike hole between the roots I knew about it long ago he said Once when you were gone a
long time I thought you must have such a place and I found it because I felt the kind of place you
would need See how the earth is tamped and the little grass is torn And while you sat in there
you stripped little pieces of bark to shreds I knew it was the place when I came upon it
Adam was staring at his father in wonder You never came here looking for me he said
No Cyrus replied I wouldnt do that You can drive a human too far I wouldnt do that
Always you must leave a man one escape before death Remember that I knew I guess how
hard I was pressing you I didnt want to push you over the edge
They moved restlessly off through the trees Cyrus said So many things I want to tell you Ill
forget most of them I want to tell you that a soldier gives up so much to get something back
From the day of a childs birth he is taught by every circumstance by every law and rule and
right to protect his own life He starts with that great instinct and everything confirms it And
then he is a soldier and he must learn to violate all of thishe must learn coldly to put himself in
the way of losing his own life without going mad And if you can do thatand mind you some
cantthen you will have the greatest gift of all Look son Cyrus said earnestly nearly all
men are afraid and they dont even know what causes their fearshadows perplexities dangers
without names or numbers fear of a faceless death But if you can bring yourself to face not
shadows but real death described and recognizable by bullet or saber arrow or lance then you
need never be afraid again at least not the same way you were before Then you will be a man set
apart from other men safe where other men may cry in terror This is the great reward Maybe
this is the only reward Maybe this is the final purity all ringed with filth Its nearly dark Ill
want to talk to you again tomorrow night when both of us have thought about what Ive told you
But Adam said Why dont you talk to my brother Charles will be going Hell be good at it
much better than I am
Charles wont be going Cyrus said Thered be no point in it
But he would be a better soldier
Only outside on his skin said Cyrus Not inside Charles is not afraid so he could never learn
anything about courage He does not know anything outside himself so he could never gain the
things Ive tried to explain to you To put him in an army would be to let loose things which in
Charles must be chained down not let loose I would not dare to let him go
Adam complained You never punished him you let him live his life you praised him you did
not haze him and now you let him stay out of the army He stopped frightened at what he had
said afraid of the rage or the contempt or the violence his words might let loose
His father did not reply He walked on out of the woodlot and his head hung down so that his
chin rested on his chest and the rise and fall of his hip when his wooden leg struck the ground
was monotonous The wooden leg made a side semicircle to get ahead when its turn came
It was completely dark by now and the golden light of the lamps shone out from the open kitchen
door Alice came to the doorway and peered out looking for them and then she heard the uneven
footsteps approaching and went back to the kitchen
Cyrus walked to the kitchen stoop before he stopped and raised his head Where are you he
asked
Hereright behind youright here
You asked a uestion I guess Ill have to answer Maybe its good and maybe its bad to answer
it Youre not clever You dont know what you want You have no proper fierceness You let
other people walk over you Sometimes I think youre a weakling who will never amount to a
dog turd Does that answer your uestion I love you better I always have This may be a bad
thing to tell you but its true I love you better Else why would I have given myself the trouble
of hurting you Now shut your mouth and go to your supper Ill talk to you tomorrow night My
leg aches
There was no talk at supper The uiet was disturbed only by the slup of soup and gnash of
chewing and his father waved his hand to try to drive the moths away from the chimney of the
kerosene lamp Adam thought his brother watched him secretly And he caught an eye flash from
Alice when he looked up suddenly After he had finished eating Adam pushed back his chair I
think Ill go for a walk he said
Charles stood up Ill go with you
Alice and Cyrus watched them go out the door and then she asked one of her rare uestions She
asked nervously What did you do
Nothing he said
Will you make him go
Yes
Does he know
Cyrus stared bleakly out the open door into the darkness Yes he knows
He wont like it Its not right for him
It doesnt matter Cyrus said and he repeated loudly It doesnt matter and his tone said
Shut your mouth This is not your affair They were silent a moment and then he said almost in
a tone of apology It isnt as though he were your child
Alice did not reply
The boys walked down the dark rutty road Ahead they could see a few pinched lights where the
village was
Want to go in and see if anythings stirring at the inn Charles asked
I hadnt thought of it said Adam
Then what the hell are you walking out at night for
You didnt have to come said Adam
Charles moved close to him What did he say to you this afternoon I saw you walking together
What did he say
He just talked about the armylike always
Didnt look like that to me Charles said suspiciously I saw him leaning close talking the
way he talks to mennot telling talking
He was telling Adam said patiently and he had to control his breath for a little fear had begun
to press up against his stomach He took as deep a gulp of air as he could and held it to push back
at the fear
What did he tell you Charles demanded again
About the army and how it is to be a soldier
I dont believe you said Charles I think youre a goddam mealymouthed liar Whatre you
trying to get away with
Nothing said Adam
Charles said harshly Your crazy mother drowned herself Maybe she took a look at you Thatd
do it
Adam let out his breath gently pressing down the dismal fear He was silent
Charles cried Youre trying to take him away I dont know how youre going about it What do
you think youre doing
Charles jumped in front of him so that Adam had to stop his chest almost against his brothers
chest Adam backed away but carefully as one backs away from a snake
Look at his birthday Charles shouted I took six bits and I bought him a knife made in
Germanythree blades and a corkscrew pearlhandled Wheres that knife Do you ever see him
use it Did he give it to you I never even saw him hone it Have you got that knife in your
pocket What did he do with it Thanks he said like that And thats the last I heard of a pearl
handled German knife that cost six bits
Rage was in his voice and Adam felt the creeping fear but he knew also that he had a moment
left Too many times he had seen the destructive machine that chopped down anything standing
in its way Rage came first and then a coldness a possession noncommittal eyes and a pleased
smile and no voice at all only a whisper When that happened murder was on the way but cool
deft murder and hands that worked precisely delicately Adam swallowed saliva to dampen his
dry throat He could think of nothing to say that would be heard for once in rage his brother
would not listen would not even hear He bulked darkly in front of Adam shorter wider thicker
but still not crouched In the starlight his lips shone with wetness but there was no smile yet and
his voice still raged
What did you do on his birthday You think I didnt see Did you spend six bits or even four
bits You brought him a mongrel pup you picked up in the woodlot You laughed like a fool and
said it would make a good bird dog That dog sleeps in his room He plays with it while hes
reading Hes got it all trained And wheres the knife Thanks he said just Thanks  Charles
spoke in a whisper and his shoulders dropped
Adam made one desperate jump backward and raised his hands to guard his face His brother
moved precisely each foot planted firmly One fist lanced delicately to get the range and then
the bitterfrozen worka hard blow in the stomach and Adams hands dropped then four
punches to the head Adam felt the bone and gristle of his nose crunch He raised his hands again
and Charles drove at his heart And all this time Adam looked at his brother as the condemned
look hopelessly and puzzled at the executioner
Suddenly to his own surprise Adam launched a wild overhand harmless swing which had
neither force nor direction Charles ducked in and under it and the helpless arm went around his
neck Adam wrapped his arms around his brother and hung close to him sobbing He felt the
suare fists whipping nausea into his stomach and still he held on Time was slowed to him With
his body he felt his brother move sideways to force his legs apart And he felt the knee come up
past his knees scraping his thighs until it crashed against his testicles and flashing white pain
ripped and echoed through his body His arms let go He bent over and vomited while the cold
killing went on
Adam felt the punches on temples cheeks eyes He felt his lip split and tatter over his teeth but
his skin seemed thickened and dull as though he were encased in heavy rubber Dully he
wondered why his legs did not buckle why he did not fall why unconsciousness did not come to
him The punching continued eternally He could hear his brother panting with the uick
explosive breath of a sledgehammer man and in the sick starlit dark he could see his brother
through the tearwatered blood that flowed from his eyes He saw the innocent noncommittal
eyes the small smile on wet lips And as he saw these thingsa flash of light and darkness
Charles stood over him gulping air like a runout dog And then he turned and walked uickly
back toward the house kneading his bruised knuckles as he went
Consciousness came back uick and frightening to Adam His mind rolled in a painful mist His
body was heavy and thick with hurt But almost instantly he forgot his hurts He heard uick
footsteps on the road The instinctive fear and fierceness of a rat came over him He pushed
himself up on his knees and dragged himself off the road to the ditch that kept it drained There
was a foot of water in the ditch and the tall grass grew up from its sides Adam crawled uietly
into the water being very careful to make no splash
The footsteps came close slowed moved on a little came back From his hiding place Adam
could see only a darkness in the dark And then a sulphur match was struck and burned a tiny
blue until the wood caught lighting his brothers face grotesuely from below Charles raised the
match and peered around and Adam could see the hatchet in his right hand
When the match went out the night was blacker than before Charles moved slowly on and struck
another match and on and struck another He searched the road for signs At last he gave it up
His right hand rose and he threw the hatchet far off into the field He walked rapidly away toward
the pinched lights of the village
For a long time Adam lay in the cool water He wondered how his brother felt wondered whether
now that his passion was chilling he would feel panic or sorrow or sick conscience or nothing
These things Adam felt for him His conscience bridged him to his brother and did his pain for
him the way at other times he had done his homework
Adam crept out of the water and stood up His hurts were stiffening and the blood was dried in a
crust on his face He thought he would stay outside in the darkness until his father and Alice went
to bed He felt that he could not answer any uestions because he did not know any answers and
trying to find one was harsh to his battered mind Dizziness edged with blue lights came fringing
his forehead and he knew that he would be fainting soon
He shuffled slowly up the road with widespread legs At the stoop he paused looked in The
lamp hanging by its chain from the ceiling cast a yellow circle and lighted Alice and her mending
basket on the table in front of her On the other side his father chewed a wooden pen and dipped
it in an open ink bottle and made entries in his black record book
Alice glancing up saw Adams bloody face Her hand rose to her mouth and her fingers hooked
over her lower teeth
Adam dragfooted up one step and then the other and supported himself in the doorway
Then Cyrus raised his head He looked with a distant curiosity The identity of the distortion
came to him slowly He stood up puzzled and wondering He stuck the wooden pen in the ink
bottle and wiped his fingers on his pants Why did he do it Cyrus asked softly
Adam tried to answer but his mouth was caked and dry He licked his lips and started them
bleeding again I dont know he said
Cyrus stumped over to him and grasped him by the arm so fiercely that he winced and tried to
pull away Dont lie to me Why did he do it Did you have an argument
No
Cyrus wrenched at him Tell me I want to know Tell me Youll have to tell me Ill make you
tell me Goddam it youre always protecting him Dont you think I know that Did you think
you were fooling me Now tell me or by God Ill keep you standing there all night
Adam cast about for an answer He doesnt think you love him
Cyrus released the arm and hobbled back to his chair and sat down He rattled the pen in the ink
bottle and looked blindly at his record book Alice he said help Adam to bed Youll have to
cut his shirt off I guess Give him a hand He got up again went to the corner of the room where
the coats hung on nails and reaching behind the garments brought out his shotgun broke it to
verify its load and clumped out of the door
Alice raised her hand as though she would hold him back with a rope of air And her rope broke
and her face hid her thoughts Go in your room she said Ill bring some water in a basin
Adam lay on the bed a sheet pulled up to his waist and Alice patted the cuts with a linen
handkerchief dipped in warm water She was silent for a long time and then she continued
Adams sentence as though there had never been an interval He doesnt think his father loves
him But you love himyou always have
Adam did not answer her
She went on uietly Hes a strange boy You have to know himall rough shell all anger until
you know She paused to cough leaned down and coughed and when the spell was over her
cheeks were flushed and she was exhausted You have to know him she repeated For a long
time he has given me little presents pretty things you wouldnt think hed even notice But he
doesnt give them right out He hides them where he knows Ill find them And you can look at
him for hours and he wont ever give the slightest sign he did it You have to know him
She smiled at Adam and he closed his eyes
Charles stood at the bar in the village inn and Charles was laughing delightedly at the funny
stories the nightstranded drummers were telling He got out his tobacco sack with its meager
jingle of silver and bought the men a drink to keep them talking He stood and grinned and
rubbed his split knuckles And when the drummers accepting his drink raised their glasses and
said Heres to you Charles was delighted He ordered another drink for his new friends and
then he joined them for some kind of deviltry in another place
When Cyrus stumped out into the night he was filled with a kind of despairing anger at Charles
He looked on the road for his son and he went to the inn to look for him but Charles was gone It
is probable that if he had found him that night he would have killed him or tried to The direction
of a big act will warp history but probably all acts do the same in their degree down to a stone
stepped over in the path or a breath caught at sight of a pretty girl or a fingernail nicked in the
garden soil
Naturally it was not long before Charles was told that his father was looking for him with a
shotgun He hid out for two weeks and when he finally did return murder had sunk back to
simple anger and he paid his penalty in overwork and a false theatrical humility
Adam lay four days in bed so stiff and aching that he could not move without a groan On the
third day his father gave evidence of his power with the military He did it as a poultice to his
own pride and also as a kind of prize for Adam Into the house into Adams bedroom came a
captain of cavalry and two sergeants in dress uniform of blue In the dooryard their horses were
held by two privates Lying in his bed Adam was enlisted in the army as a private in the cavalry
He signed the Articles of War and took the oath while his father and Alice looked on And his
fathers eyes glistened with tears
After the soldiers had gone his father sat with him a long time Ive put you in the cavalry for a
reason he said Barrack life is not a good life for long But the cavalry has work to do I made
sure of that Youll like going for the Indian country Theres action coming I cant tell you how
I know Theres fighting on the way
Yes sir Adam said
It has always seemed strange to me that it is usually men like Adam who have to do the
soldiering He did not like fighting to start with and far from learning to love it as some men do
he felt an increasing revulsion for violence Several times his officers looked closely at him for
malingering but no charge was brought During these five years of soldiering Adam did more
detail work than any man in the suadron but if he killed any enemy it was an accident of
ricochet Being a marksman and sharpshooter he was peculiarly fitted to miss By this time the
Indian fighting had become like dangerous cattle drivesthe tribes were forced into revolt
driven and decimated and the sad sullen remnants settled on starvation lands It was not nice
work but given the pattern of the countrys development it had to be done
To Adam who was an instrument who saw not the future farms but only the torn bellies of fine
humans it was revolting and useless When he fired his carbine to miss he was committing
treason against his unit and he didnt care The emotion of nonviolence was building in him until
it became a prejudice like any other thoughtstultifying prejudice To inflict any hurt on anything
for any purpose became inimical to him He became obsessed with this emotion for such it
surely was until it blotted out any possible thinking in its area But never was there any hint of
cowardice in Adams army record Indeed he was commended three times and then decorated for
bravery
As he revolted more and more from violence his impulse took the opposite direction He
ventured his life a number of times to bring in wounded men He volunteered for work in field
hospitals even when he was exhausted from his regular duties He was regarded by his comrades
with contemptuous affection and the unspoken fear men have of impulses they do not understand
Charles wrote to his brother regularlyof the farm and the village of sick cows and a foaling
mare of the added pasture and the lightningstruck barn of Alices choking death from her
consumption and his fathers move to a permanent paid position in the GAR in Washington As
with many people Charles who could not talk wrote with fullness He set down his loneliness
and his perplexities and he put on paper many things he did not know about himself
During the time Adam was away he knew his brother better than ever before or afterward In the
exchange of letters there grew a closeness neither of them could have imagined
Adam kept one letter from his brother not because he understood it completely but because it
seemed to have a covered meaning he could not get at Dear Brother Adam the letter said I
take my pen in hand to hope you are in good healthhe always started this way to ease himself
gently into the task of writing I have not had your answer to my last letter but I presume you
have other things to doha ha The rain came wrong and damned the apple blossoms There
wont be many to eat next winter but I will save what I can Tonight I cleaned the house and it is
wet and soapy and maybe not any cleaner How do you suppose Mother kept it the way she did
It does not look the same Something settles down on it I dont know what but it will not scrub
off But I have spread the dirt around more evenly anyways Ha ha
Did Father write you anything about his trip Hes gone clean out to San Francisco in California
for an encampment of the Grand Army The Secty of War is going to be there and Father is to
introduce him But this is not any great shucks to Father He has met the President three four
times and even been to supper to the White House I would like to see the White House Maybe
you and me can go together when you come home Father could put us up for a few days and he
would be wanting to see you anyways
I think I better look around for a wife This is a good farm and even if Im no bargain theres
girls could do worse than this farm What do you think You did not say if you are going to come
live home when you get out of the army I hope so I miss you
The writing stopped there There was a scratch on the page and a splash of ink and then it went
on in pencil but the writing was different
In pencil it said Later Well right there the pen gave out One of the points broke off Ill have
to buy another penpoint in the villagerusted right through
The words began to flow more smoothly I guess I should wait for a new penpoint and not write
with a pencil Only I was sitting here in the kitchen with the lamp on and I guess I got to thinking
and it come on lateafter twelve I guess but I never looked Old Black Joe started crowing out
in the henhouse Then Mothers rocking chair cricked for all the world like she was sitting in it
You know I dont take truck with that but it set me minding backward you know how you do
sometimes I guess Ill tear this letter up maybe because whats the good of writing stuff like
this
The words began to race now as though they couldnt get out fast enough If Im to throw it
away Id just as well set it down the letter said Its like the whole house was alive and had
eyes everywhere and like there was people behind the door just ready to come in if you looked
away It kind of makes my skin crawl I want to sayI want to sayI mean I never understood
well why our father did it I mean why didnt he like that knife I bought for him on his birth
day Why didnt he It was a good knife and he needed a good knife If he had used it or even
honed it or took it out of his pocket and looked at itthats all he had to do If hed liked it I
wouldnt have took out after you I had to take out after you Seems like to me my mothers chair
is rocking a little Its just the light I dont take any truck with that Seems like to me theres
something not finished Seems like when you half finished a job and cant think what it was
Something didnt get done I shouldnt be here I ought to be wandering around the world instead
of sitting here on a good farm looking for a wife There is something wrong like it didnt get
finished like it happened too soon and left something out Its me should be where you are and
you here I never thought like this before Maybe because its lateits later than that I just
looked out and its first dawn I dont think I fell off to sleep How could the night go so fast I
cant go to bed now I couldnt sleep anyways
The letter was not signed Maybe Charles forgot he had intended to destroy it and sent it along
But Adam saved it for a time and whenever he read it again it gave him a chill and he didnt
know why
On the ranch the little Hamiltons began to grow up and every year there was a new one George
was a tall handsome boy gentle and sweet who had from the first a kind of courtliness Even as a
little boy he was polite and what they used to call no trouble From his father he inherited the
neatness of clothing and body and hair and he never seemed ill dressed even when he was
George was a sinless boy and grew to be a sinless man No crime of commission was ever
attributed to him and his crimes of omission were only misdemeanors In his middle life at
about the time such things were known about it was discovered that he had pernicious anemia It
is possible that his virtue lived on a lack of energy
Behind George Will grew along dumpy and stolid Will had little imagination but he had great
energy From childhood on he was a hard worker if anyone would tell him what to work at and
once told he was indefatigable He was a conservative not only in politics but in everything
Ideas he found revolutionary and he avoided them with suspicion and distaste Will liked to live
so that no one could find fault with him and to do that he had to live as nearly like other people
as possible
Maybe his father had something to do with Wills distaste for either change or variation When
Will was a growing boy his father had not been long enough in the Salinas Valley to be thought
of as an oldtimer He was in fact a foreigner and an Irishman At that time the Irish were much
disliked in America They were looked upon with contempt particularly on the East Coast but a
little of it must have seeped out to the West And Samuel had not only variability but was a man
of ideas and innovations In small cutoff communities such a man is always regarded with
suspicion until he has proved he is no danger to the others A shining man like Samuel could and
can cause a lot of trouble He might for example prove too attractive to the wives of men who
knew they were dull Then there were his education and his reading the books he bought and
borrowed his knowledge of things that could not be eaten or worn or cohabited with his interest
in poetry and his respect for good writing If Samuel had been a rich man like the Thornes or the
Delmars with their big houses and wide flat lands he would have had a great library
The Delmars had a librarynothing but books in it and paneled in oak Samuel by borrowing
had read many more of the Delmars books than the Delmars had In that day an educated rich
man was acceptable He might send his sons to college without comment might wear a vest and
white shirt and tie in the daytime of a weekday might wear gloves and keep his nails clean And
since the lives and practices of rich men were mysterious who knows what they could use or not
use But a poor manwhat need had he for poetry or for painting or for music not fit for singing
or dancing Such things did not help him bring in a crop or keep a scrap of cloth on his childrens
backs And if in spite of this he persisted maybe he had reasons which would not stand the light
of scrutiny
Take Samuel for instance He made drawings of work he intended to do with iron or wood That
was good and understandable even enviable But on the edges of the plans he made other
drawings sometimes trees sometimes faces or animals or bugs sometimes just figures that you
couldnt make out at all And these caused men to laugh with embarrassed uneasiness Then too
you never knew in advance what Samuel would think or say or doit might be anything
The first few years after Samuel came to Salinas Valley there was a vague distrust of him And
perhaps Will as a little boy heard talk in the San Lucas store Little boys dont want their fathers
to be different from other men Will might have picked up his conservatism right then Later as
the other children came along and grew Samuel belonged to the valley and it was proud of him
in the way a man who owns a peacock is proud They werent afraid of him any more for he did
not seduce their wives or lure them out of sweet mediocrity The Salinas Valley grew fond of
Samuel but by that time Will was formed
Certain individuals not by any means always deserving are truly beloved of the gods Things
come to them without their effort or planning Will Hamilton was one of these And the gifts he
received were the ones he could appreciate As a growing boy Will was lucky Just as his father
could not make money Will could not help making it When Will Hamilton raised chickens and
his hens began to lay the price of eggs went up As a young man when two of his friends who
ran a little store came to the point of despondent bankruptcy Will was asked to lend them a little
money to tide them over the uarters bills and they gave him a onethird interest for a pittance
He was not niggardly He gave them what they asked for The store was on its feet within one
year expanding in two opening branches in three and its descendants a great mercantile system
now dominate a large part of the area
Will also took over a bicycleandtool shop for a bad debt Then a few rich people of the valley
bought automobiles and his mechanic worked on them Pressure was put on him by a
determined poet whose dreams were brass cast iron and rubber This mans name was Henry
Ford and his plans were ridiculous if not illegal Will grumblingly accepted the southern half of
the valley as his exclusive area and within fifteen years the valley was twodeep in Fords and
Will was a rich man driving a Marmon
Tom the third son was most like his father He was born in fury and he lived in lightning Tom
came headlong into life He was a giant in joy and enthusiasms He didnt discover the world
and its people he created them When he read his fathers books he was the first He lived in a
world shining and fresh and as uninspected as Eden on the sixth day His mind plunged like a colt
in a happy pasture and when later the world put up fences he plunged against the wire and when
the final stockade surrounded him he plunged right through it and out And as he was capable of
giant joy so did he harbor huge sorrow so that when his dog died the world ended
Tom was as inventive as his father but he was bolder He would try things his father would not
dare Also he had a large concupiscence to put the spurs in his flanks and this Samuel did not
have Perhaps it was his driving sexual need that made him remain a bachelor It was a very
moral family he was born into It might be that his dreams and his longing and his outlets for that
matter made him feel unworthy drove him sometimes whining into the hills Tom was a nice
mixture of savagery and gentleness He worked inhumanly only to lose in effort his crushing
impulses
The Irish do have a despairing uality of gaiety but they have also a dour and brooding ghost that
rides on their shoulders and peers in on their thoughts Let them laugh too loudly it sticks a long
finger down their throats They condemn themselves before they are charged and this makes
them defensive always
When Tom was nine years old he worried because his pretty little sister Möllie had an
impediment in her speech He asked her to open her mouth wide and saw that a membrane under
her tongue caused the trouble I can fix that he said He led her to a secret place far from the
house whetted his pocketknife on a stone and cut the offending halter of speech And then he ran
away and was sick
The Hamilton house grew as the family grew It was designed to be unfinished so that leantos
could jut out as they were needed The original room and kitchen soon disappeared in a welter of
these leantos
Meanwhile Samuel got no richer He developed a very bad patent habit a disease many men
suffer from He invented a part of a threshing machine better cheaper and more efficient than
any in existence The patent attorney ate up his little profit for the year Samuel sent his models to
a manufacturer who promptly rejected the plans and used the method The next few years were
kept lean by the suing and the drain stopped only when he lost the suit It was his first sharp
experience with the rule that without money you cannot fight money But he had caught the
patent fever and year after year the money made by threshing and by smithing was drained off in
patents The Hamilton children went barefoot and their overalls were patched and food was
sometimes scarce to pay for the crisp blueprints with cogs and planes and elevations
Some men think big and some think little Samuel and his sons Tom and Joe thought big and
George and Will thought little Joseph was the fourth sona kind of mooning boy greatly
beloved and protected by the whole family He early discovered that a smiling helplessness was
his best protection from work His brothers were tough hard workers all of them It was easier to
do Joes work than to make him do it His mother and father thought him a poet because he
wasnt any good at anything else And they so impressed him with this that he wrote glib verses
to prove it Joe was physically lazy and probably mentally lazy too He daydreamed out his life
and his mother loved him more than the others because she thought he was helpless Actually he
was the least helpless because he got exactly what he wanted with a minimum of effort Joe was
the darling of the family
In feudal times an ineptness with sword and spear headed a young man for the church in the
Hamilton family Joes inability properly to function at farm and forge headed him for a higher
education He was not sickly or weak but he did not lift very well he rode horses badly and
detested them The whole family laughed with affection when they thought of Joe trying to learn
to plow his tortuous first furrow wound about like a flatland stream and his second furrow
touched his first only once and then to cross it and wander off
Gradually he eliminated himself from every farm duty His mother explained that his mind was in
the clouds as though this were some singular virtue
When Joe had failed at every job his father in despair put him to herding sixty sheep This was
the least difficult job of all and the one classically reuiring no skill All he had to do was to stay
with the sheep And Joe lost themlost sixty sheep and couldnt find them where they were
huddled in the shade in a dry gulch According to the family story Samuel called the family
together girls and boys and made them promise to take care of Joe after he was gone for if they
did not Joe would surely starve
Interspersed with the Hamilton boys were five girls Una the oldest a thoughtful studious dark
girl LizzieI guess Lizzie must have been the oldest since she was named for her motherI
dont know much about Lizzie She early seemed to find a shame for her family She married
young and went away and thereafter was seen only at funerals Lizzie had a capacity for hatred
and bitterness uniue among the Hamiltons She had a son and when he grew up and married a
girl Lizzie didnt like she did not speak to him for many years
Then there was Dessie whose laughter was so constant that everyone near her was glad to be
there because it was more fun to be with Dessie than with anyone else
The next sister was Olive my mother And last was Mollie who was a little beauty with lovely
blond hair and violet eyes
These were the Hamiltons and it was almost a miracle how Liza skinny little biddy that she
was produced them year after year and fed them baked bread made their clothes and clothed
them with good manners and iron morals too
It is amazing how Liza stamped her children She was completely without experience in the
world she was unread and except for the one long trip from Ireland untraveled She had no
experience with men save only her husband and that she looked upon as a tiresome and
sometimes painful duty A good part of her life was taken up with bearing and raising Her total
intellectual association was the Bible except the talk of Samuel and her children and to them she
did not listen In that one book she had her history and her poetry her knowledge of peoples and
things her ethics her morals and her salvation She never studied the Bible or inspected it she
just read it The many places where it seems to refute itself did not confuse her in the least And
finally she came to a point where she knew it so well that she went right on reading it without
listening
Liza enjoyed universal respect because she was a good woman and raised good children She
could hold up her head anywhere Her husband and her children and her grandchildren respected
her There was a nailhard strength in her a lack of any compromise a Tightness in the face of all
opposing wrongness which made you hold her in a kind of awe but not in warmth
Liza hated alcoholic liuors with an iron zeal Drinking alcohol in any form she regarded as a
crime against a properly outraged deity Not only would she not touch it herself but she resisted
its enjoyment by anyone else The result naturally was that her husband Samuel and all her
children had a good lusty love for a drink
Once when he was very ill Samuel asked Liza couldnt I have a glass of whisky to ease me
She set her little hard chin Would you go to the throne of God with liuor on your breath You
would not she said
Samuel rolled over on his side and went about his illness without ease
When Liza was about seventy her elimination slowed up and her doctor told her to take a
tablespoon of port wine for medicine She forced down the first spoonful making a crooked face
but it was not so bad And from that moment she never drew a completely sober breath She
always took the wine in a tablespoon it was always medicine but after a time she was doing over
a uart a day and she was a much more relaxed and happy woman
Samuel and Liza Hamilton got all of their children raised and well toward adulthood before the
turn of the century It was a whole clot of Hamiltons growing up on the ranch to the east of King
City And they were American children and young men and women Samuel never went back to
Ireland and gradually he forgot it entirely He was a busy man He had no time for nostalgia The
Salinas Valley was the world A trip to Salinas sixty miles to the north at the head of the valley
was event enough for a year and the incessant work on the ranch the care and feeding and
clothing of his bountiful family took most of his timebut not all His energy was large
His daughter Una had become a brooding student tense and dark He was proud of her wild
exploring mind Olive was preparing to take county examinations after a stretch in the secondary
school in Salinas Olive was going to be a teacher an honor like having a priest in the family in
Ireland Joe was to be sent to college because he was no damn good at anything else Will was
well along the way to accidental fortune Tom bruised himself on the world and licked his cuts
Dessie was studying dressmaking and Mollie pretty Mollie would obviously marry some well
todo man
There was no uestion of inheritance Although the hill ranch was large it was abysmally poor
Samuel sunk well after well and could not find water on his own land That would have made the
difference Water would have made them comparatively rich The one poor pipe of water pumped
up from deep near the house was the only source sometimes it got dangerously low and twice it
went dry The cattle had to come from the far fringe of the ranch to drink and then go out again to
feed
All in all it was a good firmgrounded family permanent and successfully planted in the Salinas
Valley not poorer than many and not richer than many either It was a wellbalanced family with
its conservatives and its radicals its dreamers and its realists Samuel was well pleased with the
fruit of his loins
After Adam joined the army and Cyrus moved to Washington Charles lived alone on the farm
He boasted about getting himself a wife but he did not go about doing it by the usual process of
meeting girls taking them to dances testing their virtues or otherwise and finally slipping
feebly into marriage The truth of it was that Charles was abysmally timid of girls And like most
shy men he satisfied his normal needs in the anonymity of the prostitute There is great safety for
a shy man with a whore Having been paid for and in advance she has become a commodity and
a shy man can be gay with her and even brutal to her Also there is none of the horror of the
possible turndown which shrivels the guts of timid men
The arrangement was simple and reasonably secret The owner of the inn kept three rooms on his
top floor for transients which he rented to girls for twoweek periods At the end of two weeks a
new set of girls took their place Mr Hallam the innkeeper had no part in the arrangement He
could almost say with truth that he didnt know anything about it He simply collected five times
the normal rent for his three rooms The girls were assigned procured moved disciplined and
robbed by a whoremaster named Edwards who lived in Boston His girls moved in a slow circuit
among the small towns never staying anywhere more than two weeks It was an extremely
workable system A girl was not in town long enough to cause remark either by citizen or town
marshal They stayed pretty much in the rooms and avoided public places They were forbidden
on pain of beating to drink or make noise or to fall in love with anyone Meals were served in
their rooms and the clients were carefully screened No drunken man was permitted to go up to
them Every six months each girl was given one month of vacation to get drunk and raise hell On
the job let a girl be disobedient to the rules and Mr Edwards personally stripped her gagged
her and horsewhipped her within an inch of her life If she did it again she found herself in jail
charged with vagrancy and public prostitution
The twoweek stands had another advantage Many of the girls were diseased and a girl had
nearly always gone away by the time her gift had incubated in a client There was no one for a
man to get mad at Mr Hallam knew nothing about it and Mr Edwards never appeared publicly
in his business capacity He had a very good thing in his circuit
The girls were all pretty much alikebig healthy lazy and dull A man could hardly tell there
had been a change Charles Trask made it a habit to go to the inn at least once every two weeks
to creep up to the top floor do his uick business and return to the bar to get mildly drunk
The Trask house had never been gay but lived in only by Charles it took on a gloomy rustling
decay The lace curtains were gray the floors although swept grew sticky and dank The kitchen
was lacueredwalls windows and ceilingwith grease from the frying pans
The constant scrubbing by the wives who had lived there and the biannual deepseated scourging
had kept the dirt down Charles rarely did more than sweep He gave up sheets on his bed and
slept between blankets What good to clean the house when there was no one to see it Only on
the nights he went to the inn did he wash himself and put on clean clothes
Charles developed a restlessness that got him out at dawn He worked the farm mightily because
he was lonely Coming in from his work he gorged himself on fried food and went to bed and to
sleep in the resulting torpor
His dark face took on the serious expressionlessness of a man who is nearly always alone He
missed his brother more than he missed his mother and father He remembered uite inaccurately
the time before Adam went away as the happy time and he wanted it to come again
During the years he was never sick except of course for the chronic indigestion which was
universal and still is with men who live alone cook for themselves and eat in solitude For this
he took a powerful purge called Father Georges Elixir of Life
One accident he did have in the third year of his aloneness He was digging out rocks and
sledding them to the stone wall One large boulder was difficult to move Charles pried at it with
a long iron bar and the rock bucked and rolled back again and again Suddenly he lost his
temper The little smile came on his face and he fought the stone as though it were a man in
silent fury He drove his bar deep behind it and threw his whole weight back The bar slipped and
its upper end crashed against his forehead For a few moments he lay unconscious in the field and
then he rolled over and staggered halfblinded to the house There was a long torn welt on his
forehead from hairline to a point between his eyebrows For a few weeks his head was bandaged
over a draining infection but that did not worry him In that day pus was thought to be benign a
proof that a wound was healing properly When the wound did heal it left a long and crinkled
scar and while most scar tissue is lighter than the surrounding skin Charles scar turned dark
brown Perhaps the bar had forced iron rust under the skin and made a kind of tattoo
The wound had not worried Charles but the scar did It looked like a long fingermark laid on his
forehead He inspected it often in the little mirror by the stove He combed his hair down over
his forehead to conceal as much of it as he could He conceived a shame for his scar he hated his
scar He became restless when anyone looked at it and fury rose in him if any uestion was
asked about it In a letter to his brother he put down his feeling about it
It looks he wrote like somebody marked me like a cow The damn thing gets darker By the
time you get home it will maybe be black All I need is one going the other way and I would look
like a Papist on Ash Wednesday I dont know why it bothers me I got plenty other scars It just
seems like I was marked And when I go into town like to the inn why people are always
looking at it I can hear them talking about it when they dont know I can hear I dont know why
theyre so damn curious about it It gets so I dont feel like going in town at all
Adam was discharged in  and started to beat his way home In appearance he had changed
little There was no military carriage about him The cavalry didnt act that way Indeed some
units took pride in a sloppy posture
Adam felt that he was sleepwalking It is a hard thing to leave any deeply routined life even if
you hate it In the morning he awakened on a split second and lay waiting for reveille His calves
missed the hug of leggings and his throat felt naked without its tight collar He arrived in
Chicago and there for no reason rented a furnished room for a week stayed in it for two days
went to Buffalo changed his mind and moved to Niagara Falls He didnt want to go home and
he put it off as long as possible Home was not a pleasant place in his mind The kind of feelings
he had had there were dead in him and he had a reluctance to bring them to life He watched the
falls by the hour Their roar stupefied and hypnotized him
One evening he felt a crippling loneliness for the close men in barracks and tent His impulse was
to rush into a crowd for warmth any crowd The first crowded public place he could find was a
little bar thronged and smoky He sighed with pleasure almost nestled in the human clot the way
a cat nestles into a woodpile He ordered whisky and drank it and felt warm and good He did not
see or hear He simply absorbed the contact
As it grew late and the men began to drift away he became fearful of the time when he would
have to go home Soon he was alone with the bartender who was rubbing and rubbing the
mahogany of the bar and trying with his eyes and his manner to get Adam to go
Ill have one more Adam said
The bartender set the bottle out Adam noticed him for the first time He had a strawberry mark
on his forehead
Im a stranger in these parts said Adam
Thats what we mostly get at the falls the bartender said
Ive been in the army Cavalry
Yeah the bartender said
Adam felt suddenly that he had to impress this man had to get under his skin some way
Fighting Indians he said Had some great times
The man did not answer him
My brother has a mark on his head
The bartender touched the strawberry mark with his fingers Birthmark he said Gets bigger
every year Your brother got one
His came from a cut He wrote me about it
You notice this one of mine looks like a cat
Sure it does
Thats my nickname Cat Had it all my life They say my old lady must of been scared by a cat
when she was having me
Im on my way home Been away a long time Wont you have a drink
Thanks Where you staying
Mrs Mays boarding house
I know her What they tell is she fills you up with soup so you cant eat much meat
I guess there are tricks to every trade said Adam
I guess thats right Theres sure plenty in mine
I bet thats true said Adam
But the one trick I need I havent got I wisht I knew that one
What is it
How the hell to get you to go home and let me close up
Adam stared at him stared at him and did not speak
Its a joke the bartender said uneasily
I guess Ill go home in the morning said Adam I mean my real home
Good luck the bartender said
Adam walked through the dark town increasing his speed as though his loneliness sniffed along
behind him The sagging front steps of his boarding house creaked a warning as he climbed them
The hall was gloomed with the dot of yellow light from an oil lamp turned down so low that it
jerked expiringly
The landlady stood in her open doorway and her nose made a shadow to the bottom of her chin
Her cold eyes followed Adam as do the eyes of a frontpainted portrait and she listened with her
nose for the whisky that was in him
Good night said Adam
She did not answer him
At the top of the first flight he looked back Her head was raised and now her chin made a
shadow on her throat and her eyes had no pupils
His room smelled of dust dampened and dried many times He picked a match from his block and
scratched it on the side of the block He lighted the shank of candle in the japanned candlestick
and regarded the bedas spineless as a hammock and covered with a dirty patchwork uilt the
cotton batting spilling from the edges
The porch steps complained again and Adam knew the woman would be standing in her
doorway ready to spray inhospitality on the new arrival
Adam sat down in a straight chair and put his elbows on his knees and supported his chin in his
hands A roomer down the hall began a patient continuing cough against the uiet night
And Adam knew he could not go home He had heard old soldiers tell of doing what he was
going to do
I just couldnt stand it Didnt have no place to go Didnt know nobody Wandered around and
pretty soon I got in a panic like a kid and first thing I knowed Im begging the sergeant to let me
back inlike he was doing me a favor
Back in Chicago Adam reenlisted and asked to be assigned to his old regiment On the train
going west the men of his suadron seemed very dear and desirable
While he waited to change trains in Kansas City he heard his name called and a message was
shoved into his handorders to report to Washington to the office of the Secretary of War Adam
in his five years had absorbed rather than learned never to wonder about an order To an enlisted
man the high far gods in Washington were crazy and if a soldier wanted to keep his sanity he
thought about generals as little as possible
In due course Adam gave his name to a clerk and went to sit in an anteroom His father found
him there It took Adam a moment to recognize Cyrus and much longer to get used to him Cyrus
had become a great man He dressed like a great manblack broadcloth coat and trousers wide
black hat overcoat with a velvet collar ebony cane which he made to seem a sword And Cyrus
conducted himself like a great man His speech was slow and mellow measured and unexcited
his gestures were wide and new teeth gave him a vulpine smile out of all proportion to his
emotion
After Adam had realized that this was his father he was still puzzled Suddenly he looked down
no wooden leg The leg was straight bent at the knee and the foot was clad in a polished kid
congress gaiter When he moved there was a limp but not a clumping woodenlegged limp
Cyrus saw the look Mechanical he said Works on a hinge Got a spring Dont even limp
when I set my mind to it Ill show it to you when I take it off Come along with me
Adam said Im under orders sir Im to report to Colonel Wells
I know you are I told Wells to issue the orders Come along
Adam said uneasily If you dont mind sir I think Id better report to Colonel Wells
His father reversed himself I was testing you he said grandly I wanted to see whether the
army has any discipline these days Good boy I knew it would be good for you Youre a man
and a soldier my boy
Im under orders sir said Adam This man was a stranger to him A faint distaste arose in
Adam Something was not true And the speed with which doors opened straight to the Colonel
the obseuious respect of that officer the words The Secretary will see you now sir did not
remove Adams feeling
This is my son a private soldier Mr Secretaryjust as I wasa private soldier in the United
States Army
I was discharged a corporal sir said Adam He hardly heard the exchange of compliments He
was thinking This is the Secretary of War Cant he see that this isnt the way my father is Hes
playacting Whats happened to him Its funny the Secretary cant see it
They walked to the small hotel where Cyrus lived and on the way Cyrus pointed out the sights
the buildings the spots of history with the expansiveness of a lecturer I live in a hotel he
said Ive thought of getting a house but Im on the move so much it wouldnt hardly pay Im
all over the country most of the time
The hotel clerk couldnt see either He bowed to Cyrus called him Senator and indicated that
he would give Adam a room if he had to throw someone out
Send a bottle of whisky to my room please
I can send some chipped ice if you like
Ice said Cyrus My son is a soldier He rapped his leg with his stick and it gave forth a
hollow sound I have been a soldiera private soldier What do we want ice for
Adam was amazed at Cyruss accommodations He had not only a bedroom but a sitting room
beside it and the toilet was in a closet right in the bedroom
Cyrus sat down in a deep chair and sighed He pulled up his trouser leg and Adam saw the
contraption of iron and leather and hard wood Cyrus unlaced the leather sheath that held it on
his stump and stood the travestyonflesh beside his chair It gets to pinching pretty bad he
said
With the leg off his father became himself again the self Adam remembered He had
experienced the beginning of contempt but now the childhood fear and respect and animosity
came back to him so that he seemed a little boy testing his fathers immediate mood to escape
trouble
Cyrus made his preparations drank his whisky and loosened his collar He faced Adam Well
Sir
Why did you reenlist
II dont know sir I just wanted to
You dont like the army Adam
No sir
Why did you go back
I didnt want to go home
Cyrus sighed and rubbed the tips of his fingers on the arms of his chair Are you going to stay in
the army he asked
I dont know sir
I can get you into West Point I have influence I can get you discharged so you can enter West
Point
I dont want to go there
Are you defying me Cyrus asked uietly
Adam took a long time to answer and his mind sought escape before he said Yes sir
Cyrus said Pour me some whisky son and when he had it he continued I wonder if you
know how much influence I really have I can throw the Grand Army at any candidate like a
sock Even the President likes to know what I think about public matters I can get senators
defeated and I can pick appointments like apples I can make men and I can destroy men Do you
know that
Adam knew more than that He knew that Cyrus was defending himself with threats Yes sir
Ive heard
I could get you assigned to Washingtonassigned to me eventeach you your way about
Id rather go back to my regiment sir He saw the shadow of loss darken his fathers face
Maybe I made a mistake Youve learned the dumb resistance of a soldier He sighed Ill get
you ordered to your regiment Youll rot in barracks
Thank you sir After a pause Adam asked Why dont you bring Charles here
Because INo Charles is better where he isbetter where he is
Adam remembered his fathers tone and how he looked And he had plenty of time to remember
because he did rot in barracks He remembered that Cyrus was lonely and aloneand knew it
Charles had looked forward to Adams return after five years He had painted the house and the
barn and as the time approached he had a woman in to clean the house to clean it to the bone
She was a clean mean old woman She looked at the dustgray rotting curtains threw them out
and made new ones She dug grease out of the stove that had been there since Charles mother
died And she leached the walls of a brown shiny nastiness deposited by cooking fat and kerosene
lamps She pickled the floors with lye soaked the blankets in sal soda complaining the whole
time to herself Mendirty animals Pigs is clean compared Rot in their own juice Dont see
how no woman ever marries them Stink like measles Look at ovenpie juice from Methuselah
Charles had moved into a shed where his nostrils would not be assailed by the immaculate but
painful smells of lye and soda and ammonia and yellow soap He did however get the
impression that she didnt approve of his housekeeping When finally she grumbled away from
the shining house Charles remained in the shed He wanted to keep the house clean for Adam In
the shed where he slept were the tools of the farm and the tools for their repair and maintenance
Charles found that he could cook his fried and boiled meals more uickly and efficiently on the
forge than he could on the kitchen stove The bellows forced uick flaring heat from the coke A
man didnt have to wait for a stove to heat up He wondered why he had never thought of it
before
Charles waited for Adam and Adam did not come Perhaps Adam was ashamed to write It was
Cyrus who told Charles in an angry letter about Adams reenlistment against his wishes And
Cyrus indicated that in some future Charles could visit him in Washington but he never asked
him again
Charles moved back to the house and lived in a kind of savage filth taking a satisfaction in
overcoming the work of the grumbling woman
It was over a year before Adam wrote to Charlesa letter of embarrassed newsiness building his
courage to say I dont know why I signed again It was like somebody else doing it Write soon
and tell me how you are
Charles did not reply until he had received four anxious letters and then he replied coolly I
didnt hardly expect you anyway and he went on with a detailed account of farm and animals
Time had got in its work After that Charles wrote right after New Years and received a letter
from Adam written right after New Years They had grown so apart that there was little mutual
reference and no uestions
Charles began to keep one slovenly woman after another When they got on his nerves he threw
them out the way he would sell a pig He didnt like them and had no interest in whether or not
they liked him He grew away from the village His contacts were only with the inn and the
postmaster The village people might denounce his manner of life but one thing he had which
balanced his ugly life even in their eyes The farm had never been so well run Charles cleared
land built up his walls improved his drainage and added a hundred acres to the farm More than
that he was planting tobacco and a long new tobacco barn stood impressively behind the house
For these things he kept the respect of his neighbors A farmer cannot think too much evil of a
good farmer Charles was spending most of his money and all of his energy on the farm
Adam spent his next five years doing the things an army uses to keep its men from going insane
endless polishing of metal and leather parade and drill and escort ceremony of bugle and flag a
ballet of business for men who arent doing anything In  the big packinghouse strike broke
out in Chicago and Adams regiment entrained but the strike was settled before they were
needed In  the Seminoles who had never signed a peace treaty stirred restlessly and the
cavalry entrained again but the Seminoles retired into their swamps and were uiet and the
dreamlike routine settled on the troops again
Time interval is a strange and contradictory matter in the mind It would be reasonable to suppose
that a routine time or an eventless time would seem interminable It should be so but it is not It
is the dull eventless times that have no duration whatever A time splashed with interest
wounded with tragedy crevassed with joythats the time that seems long in the memory And
this is right when you think about it Eventlessness has no posts to drape duration on From
nothing to nothing is no time at all
Adams second five years were up before he knew it It was late in  and he was discharged
with sergeants stripes in the Presidio in San Francisco Letters between Charles and Adam had
become great rarities but Adam wrote his brother just before his discharge This time Im
coming home and that was the last Charles heard of him for over three years
Adam waited out the winter wandering up the river to Sacramento ranging in the valley of the
San Joauin and when the spring came Adam had no money He rolled a blanket and started
slowly eastward sometimes walking and sometimes with groups of men on the rods under slow
moving freight cars At night he jungled up with wandering men in the camping places on the
fringes of towns He learned to beg not for money but for food And before he knew it he was a
bindlestiff himself
Such men are rare now but in the nineties there were many of them wandering men lonely men
who wanted it that way Some of them ran from responsibilities and some felt driven out of
society by injustice They worked a little but not for long They stole a little but only food and
occasionally needed garments from a wash line They were all kinds of menliterate men and
ignorant men clean men and dirty menbut all of them had restlessness in common They
followed warmth and avoided great heat and great cold As the spring advanced they tracked it
eastward and the first frost drove them west and south They were brothers to the coyote which
being wild lives close to man and his chickenyards they were near towns but not in them
Associations with other men were for a week or for a day and then they drifted apart
Around the little fires where communal stew bubbled there was all manner of talk and only the
personal was unmentionable Adam heard of the development of the IWW with its angry
angels He listened to philosophic discussions to metaphysics to esthetics to impersonal
experience His companions for the night might be a murderer an unfrocked priest or one who
had unfrocked himself a professor forced from his warm berth by a dull faculty a lone driven
man running from memory a fallen archangel and a devil in training and each contributed bits of
thought to the fire as each contributed carrots and potatoes and onions and meat to the stew He
learned the techniue of shaving with broken glass of judging a house before knocking to ask for
a handout He learned to avoid or get along with hostile police and to evaluate a woman for her
warmth of heart
Adam took pleasure in the new life When autumn touched the trees he had got as far as Omaha
and without uestion or reason or thought he hurried west and south fled through the mountains
and arrived with relief in Southern California He wandered by the sea from the border north as
far as San Luis Obispo and he learned to pilfer the tide pools for abalones and eels and mussels
and perch to dig the sandbars for clams and to trap a rabbit in the dunes with a noose of fishline
And he lay in the sunwarmed sand counting the waves
Spring urged him east again but more slowly than before Summer was cool in the mountains
and the mountain people were kind as lonesome people are kind Adam took a job on a widows
outfit near Denver and shared her table and her bed humbly until the frost drove him south again
He followed the Rio Grande past Albuuerue and El Paso through the Big Bend through
Laredo to Brownsville He learned Spanish words for food and pleasure and he learned that
when people are very poor they still have something to give and the impulse to give it He
developed a love for poor people he could not have conceived if he had not been poor himself
And by now he was an expert tramp using humility as a working principle He was lean and sun
darkened and he could withdraw his own personality until he made no Stir of anger or jealousy
His voice had grown soft and he had merged many accents and dialects into his own speech so
that his speech did not seem foreign anywhere This was the great safety of the tramp a
protective veil He rode the trains very infreuently for there was a growing anger against
tramps based on the angry violence of the IWW and aggravated by the fierce reprisals against
them Adam was picked up for vagrancy The uick brutality of police and prisoners frightened
him and drove him away from the gatherings of tramps He traveled alone after that and made
sure that he was shaven and clean
When spring came again he started north He felt that his time of rest and peace was over He
aimed north toward Charles and the weakening memories of his childhood
Adam moved rapidly across interminable East Texas through Louisiana and the butt ends of
Mississippi and Alabama and into the flank of Florida He felt that he had to move uickly The
Negroes were poor enough to be kind but they could not trust any white man no matter how
poor and the poor white men had a fear of strangers
Near Tallahassee he was picked up by sheriffs men judged vagrant and put on a road gang
Thats how the roads were built His sentence was six months He was released and instantly
picked up again for a second six months And now he learned how men can consider other men
as beasts and that the easiest way to get along with such men was to be a beast A clean face an
open face an eye raised to meet an eyethese drew attention and attention drawn brought
punishment Adam thought how a man doing an ugly or a brutal thing has hurt himself and must
punish someone for the hurt To be guarded at work by men with shotguns to be shackled by the
ankle at night to a chain were simple matters of precaution but the savage whippings for the
least stir of will for the smallest shred of dignity or resistance these seemed to indicate that
guards were afraid of prisoners and Adam knew from his years in the army that a man afraid is a
dangerous animal And Adam like anyone in the world feared what whipping would do to his
body and his spirit He drew a curtain around himself He removed expression from his face light
from his eyes and silenced his speech Later he was not so much astonished that it had happened
to him but that he had been able to take it and with a minimum of pain It was much more
horrible afterward than when it was happening It is a triumph of selfcontrol to see a man
whipped until the muscles of his back show white and glistening through the cuts and to give no
sign of pity or anger or interest And Adam learned this
People are felt rather than seen after the first few moments During his second sentence on the
roads of Florida Adam reduced his personality to a minus He caused no stir put out no
vibration became as nearly invisible as it is possible to be And when the guards could not feel
him they were not afraid of him They gave him the jobs of cleaning the camps of handing out
the slops to the prisoners of filling the water buckets
Adam waited until three days before his second release Right after noon that day he filled the
water buckets and went back to the little river for more He filled his buckets with stones and
sank them and then he eased himself into the water and swam a long way downstream rested
and swam farther down He kept moving in the water until at dusk he found a place under a bank
with bushes for cover He did not get out of the water
Late in the night he heard the hounds go by covering both sides of the river He had rubbed his
hair hard with green leaves to cover human odor He sat in the water with his nose and eyes clear
In the morning the hounds came back disinterested and the men were too tired to beat the banks
properly When they were gone Adam dug a piece of waterlogged fried sowbelly out of his
pocket and ate it
He had schooled himself against hurry Most men were caught bolting It took Adam five days to
cross the short distance into Georgia He took no chances held back his impatience with an iron
control He was astonished at his ability
On the edge of Valdosta Georgia he lay hidden until long after midnight and he entered the
town like a shadow crept to the rear of a cheap store forced a window slowly so that the screws
of the lock were pulled from the sunrotted wood Then he replaced the lock but left the window
open He had to work by moonlight drifting through dirty windows He stole a pair of cheap
trousers a white shirt black shoes black hat and an oilskin raincoat and he tried on each article
for fit He forced himself to make sure nothing looked disturbed before he climbed out the
window He had taken nothing which was not heavily stocked He had not even looked for the
cash drawer He lowered the window carefully and slipped from shadow to shadow in the
moonlight
He lay hidden during the day and went in search of food at nightturnips a few ears of corn
from a crib a few windfall applesnothing that would be missed He broke the newness of the
shoes with rubbed sand and kneaded the raincoat to destroy its newness It was three days before
he got the rain he needed or in his extreme caution felt he needed
The rain started late in the afternoon Adam huddled under his oilskin waiting for the dark to
come and when it did he walked through the dripping night into the town of Valdosta His black
hat was pulled down over his eyes and his yellow oilskin was strapped tight against his throat He
made his way to the station and peered through a rainblurred window The station agent in green
eyeshade and black alpaca worksleeves leaned through the ticket window talking to a friend It
was twenty minutes before the friend went away Adam watched him off the platform He took a
deep breath to calm himself and went inside
Charles received very few letters Sometimes he did not inuire at the post office for weeks In
February of  when a thick letter came from a firm of attorneys in Washington the postmaster
thought it might be important He walked out to the Trask farm found Charles cutting wood and
gave him the letter And since he had taken so much trouble he waited around to hear what the
letter said
Charles let him wait Very slowly he read all five pages went back and read them again moving
his lips over the words Then he folded it up and turned toward the house
The postmaster called after him Anything wrong Mr Trask
My father is dead Charles said and he walked into the house and closed the door
Took it hard the postmaster reported in town Took it real hard uiet man Dont talk much
In the house Charles lighted the lamp although it was not dark yet He laid the letter on the table
and he washed his hands before he sat down to read it again
There hadnt been anyone to send him a telegram The attorneys had found his address among his
fathers papers They were sorryoffered their condolences And they were pretty excited too
When they had made Trasks will they thought he might have a few hundred dollars to leave his
sons That is what he looked to be worth When they inspected his bankbooks they found that he
had over ninetythree thousand dollars in the bank and ten thousand dollars in good securities
They felt very different about Mr Trask then People with that much money were rich They
would never have to worry It was enough to start a dynasty The lawyers congratulated Charles
and his brother Adam Under the will they said it was to be shared eually After the money they
listed the personal effects left by the deceased five ceremonial swords presented to Cyrus at
various GAR conventions an olive wood gavel with a gold plate on it a Masonic watch charm
with a diamond set in the dividers the gold caps from the teeth he had out when he got his
plates watch silver goldheaded stick and so forth
Charles read the letter twice more and cupped his forehead in his hands He wondered about
Adam He wanted Adam home
Charles felt puzzled and dull He built up the fire and put the frying pan to heat and sliced thick
pieces of salt pork into it Then he went back to stare at the letter Suddenly he picked it up and
put it in the drawer of the kitchen table He decided not to think of the matter at all for a while
Of course he thought of little else but it was a dull circular thinking that came back to the starting
point again and again Where had he gotten it
When two events have something in common in their natures or in time or place we leap happily
to the conclusion that they are similar and from this tendency we create magics and store them for
retelling Charles had never before had a letter delivered at the farm in his life Some weeks later
a boy ran out to the farm with a telegram Charles always connected the letter and the telegram
the way we group two deaths and anticipate a third He hurried to the village railroad station
carrying the telegram in his hand
Listen to this he said to the operator
I already read it
You did
It comes over the wire said the operator I wrote it down
Oh Yes sure Urgent need you telegraph me one hundred dollars Coming home Adam
Came collect the operator said You owe me sixty cents
Valdosta GeorgiaI never heard of it
Neitherd I but its there
Say Carlton how do you go about telegraphing money
Well you bring me a hundred and two dollars and sixty cents and I send a wire telling the
Valdosta operator to pay Adam one hundred dollars You owe me sixty cents too
Ill paysay how do I know its Adam Whats to stop anybody from collecting it
The operator permitted himself a smile of worldliness Way we go about it you give me a
uestion couldnt nobody else know the answer So I send both the uestion and the answer
Operator asks this fella the uestion and if he cant answer he dont get the money
Say thats pretty cute I better think up a good one
You better get the hundred dollars while Old Breen still got the window open
Charles was delighted with the game He came back with the money in his hand I got the
uestion he said
I hope it aint your mothers middle name Lot of people dont remember
No nothing like that Its this What did you give Father on his birthday just before you went in
the army
Its a good uestion but its long as hell Cant you cut it down to ten words
Whos paying for it Answer is A pup
Wouldnt nobody guess that said Carlton Well its you paying not me
Be funny if he forgot said Charles He wouldnt ever get home
Adam came walking out from the village His shirt was dirty and the stolen clothes were wrinkled
and soiled from having been slept in for a week Between the house and the barn he stopped and
listened for his brother and in a moment he heard him hammering at something in the big new
tobacco barn Oh Charles Adam called
The hammering stopped and there was silence Adam felt as though his brother were inspecting
him through the cracks in the barn Then Charles came out uickly and hurried to Adam and
shook hands
How are you
Fine said Adam
Good God youre thin
I guess I am And Im years older too
Charles inspected him from head to foot You dont look prosperous
Im not
Wheres your valise
I havent got one
Jesus Christ Whereve you been
Mostly wandering around all over
Like a hobo
After all the years and the life that had made creased leather out of Charles skin and redness in
his dark eyes Adam knew from remembering that Charles was thinking of two thingsthe
uestions and something else
Why didnt you come home
I just got to wandering Couldnt stop It gets into you Thats a real bad scar youve got there
Thats the one I wrote you about Gets worse all the time Why didnt you write Are you
hungry Charles hands itched into his pockets and out and touched his chin and scratched his
head
It may go away I saw a man oncebartenderhe had one that looked like a cat It was a
birthmark His nickname was Cat
Are you hungry
Sure I guess I am
Plan to stay home now
II guess so Do you want to get to it now
II guess so Charles echoed him Our father is dead
I know
How the hell do you know
Station agent told me How long ago did he die
Bout a month
What of
Pneumonia
Buried here
No In Washington I got a letter and newspapers Carried him on a caisson with a flag over it
The VicePresident was there and the President sent a wreath All in the papers Pictures tooIll
show you Ive got it all
Adam studied his brothers face until Charles looked away Are you mad at something Adam
What should I be mad at
It just sounded
Ive got nothing to be mad at Come on Ill get you something to eat
All right Did he linger long
No It was galloping pneumonia Went right out
Charles was covering up something He wanted to tell it but he didnt know how to go about it
He kept hiding in words Adam fell silent It might be a good thing to be uiet and let Charles
sniff and circle until he came out with it
I dont take much stock in messages from the beyond said Charles Still how can you know
Some people claim theyve had messagesold Sarah Whitburn She swore You just dont know
what to think You didnt get a message did you Say what the hells bit off your tongue
Adam said Just thinking And he was thinking with amazement Why Im not afraid of my
brother I used to be scared to death of him and Im not any more Wonder why not Could it be
the army Or the chain gang Could it be Fathers death Maybebut I dont understand it With
the lack of fear he knew he could say anything he wanted to whereas before he had picked over
his words to avoid trouble It was a good feeling he had almost as though he himself had been
dead and resurrected
They walked into the kitchen he remembered and didnt remember It seemed smaller and
dingier Adam said almost gaily Charles I been listening You want to tell me something and
youre walking around it like a terrier around a bush You better tell before it bites you
Charles eyes sparked up with anger He raised his head His force was gone He thought with
desolation I cant lick him any more I cant
Adam chuckled Maybe its wrong to feel good when our fathers just died but you know
Charles I never felt better in my whole life I never felt as good Spill it Charles Dont let it
chew on you
Charles asked Did you love our father
I wont answer you until I know what youre getting at
Did you or didnt you
Whats that got to do with you
Tell me
The creative free boldness was all through Adams bones and brain All right Ill tell you No I
didnt Sometimes he scared me Sometimesyes sometimes I admired him but most of the
time I hated him Now tell me why you want to know
Charles was looking down at his hands I dont understand he said I just cant get it through
my head He loved you more than anything in the world
I dont believe that
You dont have to He liked everything you brought him He didnt like me He didnt like
anything I gave him Remember the present I gave him the pocketknife I cut and sold a load of
wood to get that knife Well he didnt even take it to Washington with him Its right in his
bureau right now And you gave him a pup It didnt cost you a thing Well Ill show you a
picture of that pup It was at his funeral A colonel was holding itit was blind couldnt walk
They shot it after the funeral
Adam was puzzled at the fierceness of his brothers tone I dont see he said I dont see what
youre getting at
I loved him said Charles And for the first time that Adam could remember Charles began to
cry He put his head down in his arms and cried
Adam was about to go to him when a little of the old fear came back No he thought if I touched
him he would try to kill me He went to the open doorway and stood looking out and he could
hear his brothers sniffling behind him
It was not a pretty farm near the housenever had been There was litter about it an
unkemptness a rundownness a lack of plan no flowers and bits of paper and scraps of wood
scattered about on the ground The house was not pretty either It was a wellbuilt shanty for
shelter and cooking It was a grim farm and a grim house unloved and unloving It was no home
no place to long for or to come back to Suddenly Adam thought of his stepmotheras unloved
as the farm adeuate clean in her way but no more wife than the farm was a home
His brothers sobbing had stopped Adam turned Charles was looking blankly straight ahead
Adam said Tell me about Mother
She died I wrote you
Tell me about her
I told you She died Its so long ago She wasnt your mother
The smile Adam had once caught on her face flashed up in his mind Her face was projected in
front of him
Charles voice came through the image and exploded it Will you tell me one thingnot uick
think before you tell me and maybe dont answer unless its true your answer
Charles moved his lips to form the uestion in advance Do you think it would be possible for
our father to bedishonest
What do you mean
Isnt that plain enough I said it plain Theres only one meaning to dishonest
I dont know said Adam I dont know No one ever said it Look what he got to be Stayed
overnight in the White House The VicePresident came to his funeral Does that sound like a
dishonest man Come on Charles he begged tell me what youve been wanting to tell me
from the minute I got here
Charles wet his lips The blood seemed to have gone out of him and with it energy and all
ferocity His voice became a monotone Father made a will Left everything eual to me and
you
Adam laughed Well we can always live on the farm I guess we wont starve
Its over a hundred thousand dollars the dull voice went on
Youre crazy More like a hundred dollars Where would he get it
Its no mistake His salary with the GAR was a hundred and thirtyfive dollars a month He
paid his own room and board He got five cents a mile and hotel expenses when he traveled
Maybe he had it all the time and we never knew
No he didnt have it all the time
Well why dont we write to the GAR and ask Someone there might know
I wouldnt dare said Charles
Now look Dont go off halfcocked Theres such a thing as speculation Lots of men struck it
rich He knew big men Maybe he got in on a good thing Think of the men who went to the gold
rush in California and came back rich
Charles face was desolate His voice dropped so that Adam had to lean close to hear It was as
toneless as a report Our father went into the Union Army in June  He had three months
training here in this state That makes it September He marched south October twelfth he was
hit in the leg and sent to the hospital He came home in January
I dont see what youre getting at
Charles words were thin and sallow He was not at Chancellorsville He was not at Gettysburg
or the Wilderness or Richmond or Appomattox
How do you know
His discharge It came down with his other papers
Adam sighed deeply In his chest like beating fists was a surge of joy He shook his head almost
in disbelief
Charles said How did he get away with it How in hell did he get away with it Nobody ever
uestioned it Did you Did I Did my mother Nobody did Not even in Washington
Adam stood up Whats in the house to eat Im going to warm up something
I killed a chicken last night Ill fry it if you can wait
Anything uick
Some salt pork and plenty of eggs
Ill have that said Adam
They left the uestion lying there walked mentally around it stepped over it Their words
ignored it but their minds never left it They wanted to talk about it and could not Charles fried
salt pork warmed up a skillet of beans fried eggs
I plowed the pasture he said Put it in rye
How did it do
Just fine once I got the rocks out He touched his forehead I got this damn thing trying to pry
out a stone
You wrote about that Adam said Dont know whether I told you your letters meant a lot to
me
You never wrote much what you were doing said Charles
I guess I didnt want to think about it It was pretty bad most of it
I read about the campaigns in the papers Did you go on those
Yes I didnt want to think about them Still dont
Did you kill Injuns
Yes we killed Injuns
I guess theyre real ornery
I guess so
You dont have to talk about it if you dont want to
I dont want to
They ate their dinner under the kerosene lamp Wed get more light if I would only get around to
washing that lampshade
Ill do it said Adam Its hard to think of everything
Its going to be fine having you back How would you like to go to the inn after supper
Well well see Maybe Id like just to sit awhile
I didnt write about it in a letter but theyve got girls at the inn I didnt know but youd like to
go in with me They change every two weeks I didnt know but youd like to look them over
Girls
Yes theyre upstairs Makes it pretty handy And I thought you just coming home
Not tonight Maybe later How much do they charge
A dollar Pretty nice girls mostly
Maybe later said Adam Im surprised they let them come in
I was too at first But they worked out a system
You go often
Every two or three weeks Its pretty lonesome here a man living alone
You wrote once you were thinking of getting married
Well I was Guess I didnt find the right girl
All around the main subject the brothers beat Now and then they would almost step into it and
uickly pull away back into crops and local gossip and politics and health They knew they
would come back to it sooner or later Charles was more anxious to strike in deep than Adam
was but then Charles had had the time to think of it and to Adam it was a new field of thinking
and feeling He would have preferred to put it over until another day and at the same time he
knew his brother would not permit him to
Once he said openly Lets sleep on that other thing
Sure if you want to said Charles
Gradually they ran out of escape talk Every acuaintance was covered and every local event
The talk lagged and the time went on
Feel like turning in Adam asked
In a little while
They were silent and the night moved restlessly about the house nudging them and urging them
I sure would like tove seen that funeral said Charles
Must have been pretty fancy
Would you care to see the clippings from the papers Ive got them all in my room
No Not tonight
Charles suared his chair around and put his elbows on the table Well have to figure it out he
said nervously We can put it off all we want but we goddam well got to figure what were
I know that said Adam I guess I just wanted some time to think about it
Would that do any good Ive had time lots of time and I just went in circles I tried not to
think about it and I still went in circles You think time is going to help
I guess not I guess not What do you want to talk about first I guess we might as well get into
it Were not thinking about anything else
Theres the money said Charles Over a hundred thousand dollarsa fortune
What about the money
Well where did it come from
How do I know I told you he might have speculated Somebody might have put him onto a
good thing there in Washington
Do you believe that
I dont believe anything Adam said I dont know so what can I believe
Its a lot of money said Charles Its a fortune left to us We can live the rest of our lives on it
or we can buy a hell of a lot of land and make it pay Maybe you didnt think about it but were
rich Were richer than anybody hereabouts
Adam laughed You say it like it was a jail sentence
Where did it come from
What do you care Adam asked Maybe we should just settle back and enjoy it
He wasnt at Gettysburg He wasnt at any goddam battle in the whole war He was hit in a
skirmish Everything he told was lies
What are you getting at said Adam
I think he stole the money Charles said miserably You asked me and thats what I think
Do you know where he stole it
Then why do you think he stole it
He told lies about the war
What
I mean if he lied about the warwhy he could steal
How
He held jobs in the GARbig jobs He maybe could have got into the treasury rigged the
books
Adam sighed Well if thats what you think why dont you write to them and tell them Have
them go over the books If its true we could give back the money
Charles face was twisted and the scar on his forehead showed dark The VicePresident came
to his funeral The President sent a wreath There was a line of carriages half a mile long and
hundreds of people on foot And do you know who the pall bearers were
What are you digging at
Spose we found out hes a thief Then it would come out how he never was at Gettysburg or
anyplace else Then everybody would know he was a liar too and his whole life was a goddam
lie Then even if sometimes he did tell the truth nobody would believe it was the truth
Adam sat very still His eyes were untroubled but he was watchful I thought you loved him he
said calmly He felt released and free
I did I do Thats why I hate thishis whole life goneall gone And his gravethey might
even dig him up and throw him out His words were ragged with emotion Didnt you love him
at all he cried
I wasnt sure until now said Adam I was all mixed up with how I was supposed to feel No I
did not love him
Then you dont care if his life is spoiled and his poor body rooted up andoh my God
almighty
Adams brain raced trying to find words for his feeling I dont have to care
No you dont Charles said bitterly Not if you didnt love him you dont You can help kick
him in the face
Adam knew that his brother was no longer dangerous There was no jealousy to drive him The
whole weight of his father was on him but it was his father and no one could take his father away
from him
How will you feel walking in town after everyone knows Charles demanded How will you
face anybody
I told you I dont care I dont have to care because I dont believe it
You dont believe what
I dont believe he stole any money I believe in the war he did just what he said he did and was
just where he said he was
But the proofhow about the discharge
You havent any proof that he stole You just made that up because you dont know where the
money came from
His army papers
They could be wrong Adam said I believe they are wrong I believe in my father
I dont see how you can
Adam said Let me tell you The proofs that God does not exist are very strong but in lots of
people they are not as strong as the feeling that He does
But you said you did not love our father How can you have faith in him if you didnt love him
Maybe thats the reason Adam said slowly feeling his way Maybe if I had loved him I
would have been jealous of him You were Maybemaybe love makes you suspicious and
doubting Is it true that when you love a woman you are never surenever sure of her because
you arent sure of yourself I can see it pretty clearly I can see how you loved him and what it
did to you I did not love him Maybe he loved me He tested me and hurt me and punished me
and finally he sent me out like a sacrifice maybe to make up for something But he did not love
you and so he had faith in you Maybewhy maybe its a kind of reverse
Charles stared at him I dont understand he said

I couldnt ever go away from here said Charles
Well lets see how it goes Theres no hurry Well feel it out
I believe there are monsters born in the world to human parents Some you can see misshapen
and horrible with huge heads or tiny bodies some are born with no arms no legs some with
three arms some with tails or mouths in odd places They are accidents and no ones fault as
used to be thought Once they were considered the visible punishment for concealed sins
And just as there are physical monsters can there not be mental or psychic monsters born The
face and body may be perfect but if a twisted gene or a malformed egg can produce physical
monsters may not the same process produce a malformed soul
Monsters are variations from the accepted normal to a greater or a less degree As a child may be
born without an arm so one may be born without kindness or the potential of conscience A man
who loses his arms in an accident has a great struggle to adjust himself to the lack but one born
without arms suffers only from people who find him strange Having never had arms he cannot
miss them Sometimes when we are little we imagine how it would be to have wings but there is
no reason to suppose it is the same feeling birds have No to a monster the norm must seem
monstrous since everyone is normal to himself To the inner monster it must be even more
obscure since he has no visible thing to compare with others To a man born without conscience
a soulstricken man must seem ridiculous To a criminal honesty is foolish You must not forget
that a monster is only a variation and that to a monster the norm is monstrous
It is my belief that Cathy Ames was born with the tendencies or lack of them which drove and
forced her all of her life Some balance wheel was misweighted some gear out of ratio She was
not like other people never was from birth And just as a cripple may learn to utilize his lack so
that he becomes more effective in a limited field than the uncrippled so did Cathy using her
difference make a painful and bewildering stir in her world
There was a time when a girl like Cathy would have been called possessed by the devil She
would have been exorcised to cast out the evil spirit and if after many trials that did not work
she would have been burned as a witch for the good of the community The one thing that may
not be forgiven a witch is her ability to distress people to make them restless and uneasy and
even envious
As though nature concealed a trap Cathy had from the first a face of innocence Her hair was
gold and lovely wideset hazel eyes with upper lids that drooped made her look mysteriously
sleepy Her nose was delicate and thin and her cheekbones high and wide sweeping down to a
small chin so that her face was heartshaped Her mouth was well shaped and well lipped but
abnormally smallwhat used to be called a rosebud Her ears were very little without lobes and
they pressed so close to her head that even with her hair combed up they made no silhouette
They were thin flaps sealed against her head
Cathy always had a childs figure even after she was grown slender delicate arms and hands
tiny hands Her breasts never developed very much Before her puberty the nipples turned
inward Her mother had to manipulate them out when they became painful in Cathys tenth year
Her body was a boys body narrowhipped straightlegged but her ankles were thin and
straight without being slender Her feet were small and round and stubby with fat insteps almost
like little hoofs She was a pretty child and she became a pretty woman Her voice was huskily
soft and it could be so sweet as to be irresistible But there must have been some steel cord in her
throat for Cathys voice could cut like a file when she wished
Even as a child she had some uality that made people look at her then look away then look
back at her troubled at something foreign Something looked out of her eyes and was never there
when one looked again She moved uietly and talked little but she could enter no room without
causing everyone to turn toward her
She made people uneasy but not so that they wanted to go away from her Men and women
wanted to inspect her to be close to her to try to find what caused the disturbance she distributed
so subtly And since this had always been so Cathy did not find it strange
Cathy was different from other children in many ways but one thing in particular set her apart
Most children abhor difference They want to look talk dress and act exactly like all of the
others If the style of dress is an absurdity it is pain and sorrow to a child not to wear that
absurdity If necklaces of pork chops were accepted it would be a sad child who could not wear
pork chops And this slavishness to the group normally extends into every game every practice
social or otherwise It is a protective coloration children utilize for their safety
Cathy had none of this She never conformed in dress or conduct She wore whatever she
wanted to The result was that uite often other children imitated her
As she grew older the group the herd which is any collection of children began to sense what
adults felt that there was something foreign about Cathy After a while only one person at a time
associated with her Groups of boys and girls avoided her as though she carried a nameless
danger
Cathy was a liar but she did not lie the way most children do Hers was no daydream lying when
the thing imagined is told and to make it seem more real told as real That is just ordinary
deviation from external reality I think the difference between a lie and a story is that a story
utilizes the trappings and appearance of truth for the interest of the listener as well as of the
teller A story has in it neither gain nor loss But a lie is a device for profit or escape I suppose if
that definition is strictly held to then a writer of stories is a liarif he is financially fortunate
Cathys lies were never innocent Their purpose was to escape punishment or work or
responsibility and they were used for profit Most liars are tripped up either because they forget
what they have told or because the lie is suddenly faced with an incontrovertible truth But Cathy
did not forget her lies and she developed the most effective method of lying She stayed close
enough to the truth so that one could never be sure She knew two other methods alsoeither to
interlard her lies with truth or to tell a truth as though it were a lie If one is accused of a lie and
it turns out to be the truth there is a backlog that will last a long time and protect a number of
untruths
Since Cathy was an only child her mother had no close contrast in the family She thought all
children were like her own And since all parents are worriers she was convinced that all her
friends had the same problems
Cathys father was not so sure He operated a small tannery in a town in Massachusetts which
made a comfortable careful living if he worked very hard Mr Ames came in contact with other
children away from his home and he felt that Cathy was not like other children It was a matter
more felt than known He was uneasy about his daughter but he could not have said why
Nearly everyone in the world has appetites and impulses trigger emotions islands of
selfishness lusts just beneath the surface And most people either hold such things in check or
indulge them secretly Cathy knew not only these impulses in others but how to use them for her
own gain It is uite possible that she did not believe in any other tendencies in humans for while
she was preternaturally alert in some directions she was completely blind in others
Cathy learned when she was very young that sexuality with all its attendant yearnings and pains
jealousies and taboos is the most disturbing impulse humans have And in that day it was even
more disturbing than it is now because the subject was unmentionable and unmentioned
Everyone concealed that little hell in himself while publicly pretending it did not existand
when he was caught up in it he was completely helpless Cathy learned that by the manipulation
and use of this one part of people she could gain and keep power over nearly everyone It was at
once a weapon and a threat It was irresistible And since the blind helplessness seems never to
have fallen on Cathy it is probable that she had very little of the impulse herself and indeed felt a
contempt for those who did And when you think of it in one way she was right
What freedom men and women could have were they not constantly tricked and trapped and
enslaved and tortured by their sexuality The only drawback in that freedom is that without it one
would not be a human One would be a monster
At ten Cathy knew something of the power of the sex impulse and began coldly to experiment
with it She planned everything coldly foreseeing difficulties and preparing for them
The sex play of children has always gone on Everyone I guess who is not abnormal has
foregathered with little girls in some dim leafy place in the bottom of a manger under a willow
in a culvert under a roador at least has dreamed of doing so Nearly all parents are faced with
the problem sooner or later and then the child is lucky if the parent remembers his own child
hood In the time of Cathys childhood however it was harder The parents denying it in
themselves were horrified to find it in their children
On a spring morning when with latesurviving dew the young grass bristled under the sun when
the warmth crept into the ground and pushed the yellow dandelions up Cathys mother finished
hanging the washed clothes on the line The Ameses lived on the edge of town and behind their
house were barn and carriage house vegetable garden and fenced paddock for two horses
Mrs Ames remembered having seen Cathy stroll away toward the barn She called for her and
when there was no answer she thought she might have been mistaken She was about to go into
the house when she heard a giggle from the carriage house Cathy she called There was no
answer An uneasiness came over her She reached back in her mind for the sound of the giggle
It had not been Cathys voice Cathy was not a giggler
There is no knowing how or why dread comes on a parent Of course many times apprehension
arises when there is no reason for it at all And it comes most often to the parents of only
children parents who have indulged in black dreams of loss
Mrs Ames stood still listening She heard soft secret voices and moved uietly toward the
carriage house The double doors were closed The murmur of voices came from inside but she
could not make out Cathys voice She made a uick stride and pulled the doors open and the
bright sun crashed inside She froze mouth open at what she saw Cathy lay on the floor her
skirts pulled up She was naked to the waist and beside her two boys about fourteen were
kneeling The shock of the sudden light froze them too Cathys eyes were blank with terror Mrs
Ames knew the boys knew their parents
Suddenly one of the boys leaped up darted past Mrs Ames and ran around the corner of the
house The other boy helplessly edged away from the woman and with a cry rushed through the
doorway Mrs Ames clutched at him but her fingers slipped from his jacket and he was gone
She could hear his runningfootsteps outside
Mrs Ames tried to speak and her voice was a croaking whisper Get up
Cathy stared blankly up at her and made no move Mrs Ames saw that Cathys wrists were tied
with a heavy rope She screamed and flung herself down and fumbled at the knots She carried
Cathy into the house and put her to bed
The family doctor after he had examined Cathy could find no evidence that she had been
mistreated You can just thank God you got there in time he said over and over to Mrs Ames
Cathy did not speak for a long time Shock the doctor called it And when she did come out of
the shock Cathy refused to talk When she was uestioned her eyes widened until the whites
showed all around the pupils and her breathing stopped and her body grew rigid and her cheeks
reddened from holding her breath
The conference with the parents of the boys was attended by Dr Williams Mr Ames was silent
most of the time He carried the rope which had been around Cathys wrists His eyes were
puzzled There were things he did not understand but he did not bring them up
Mrs Ames settled down to a steady hysteria She had been there She had seen She was the final
authority And out of her hysteria a sadistic devil peered She wanted blood There was a kind of
pleasure in her demands for punishment The town the country must be protected She put it on
that basis She had arrived in time thank God But maybe the next time she would not and how
would other mothers feel And Cathy was only ten years old
Punishments were more savage then than they are now A man truly believed that the whip was
an instrument of virtue First singly and then together the boys were whipped whippedto raw
cuts
Their crime was bad enough but the lies proved an evil that not even the whip could remove
And their defense was from the beginning ridiculous Cathy they said had started the whole
thing and they had each given her five cents They had not tied her hands They said they
remembered that she was playing with a rope
Mrs Ames said it first and the whole town echoed it Do they mean to say she tied her own
hands A tenyearold child
If the boys had owned up to the crime they might have escaped some of the punishment Their
refusal brought a torturing rage not only to their fathers who did the whipping but to the whole
community Both boys were sent to a house of correction with the approval of their parents
Shes haunted by it Mrs Ames told the neighbors If she could only talk about it maybe she
would get better But when I ask her about itits like it came right back to her and she goes into
shock again
The Ameses never spoke of it to her again The subject was closed Mr Ames very soon forgot
his haunting reservations He would have felt bad if two boys were in the house of correction for
something they did not do
After Cathy had fully recovered from her shock boys and girls watched her from a distance and
then moved closer fascinated by her She had no girl crushes as is usual at twelve and thirteen
Boys did not want to take the chance of being ragged by their friends for walking home from
school with her But she exercised a powerful effect on both boys and girls And if any boy
could come on her alone he found himself drawn to her by a force he could neither understand
nor overcome
She was dainty and very sweet and her voice was low She went for long walks by herself and it
was a rare walk when some boy did not blunder out of a woodlot and come on her by accident
And while whispers went scurrying about there is no knowing what Cathy did If anything
happened only vague whispers followed and this in itself was unusual at an age when there are
many secrets and none of them kept long enough to raise a cream
Cathy developed a little smile just a hint of a smile She had a way of looking sideways and
down that hinted to a lone boy of secrets he could share
In her fathers mind another uestion stirred and he shoved it down deep and felt dishonest for
thinking about it at all Cathy had remarkable luck in finding thingsa gold charm money a
little silken purse a silver cross with red stones said to be rubies She found many things and
when her father advertised in the weekly Courier about the cross no one ever claimed it
Mr William Ames Cathys father was a covered man He rarely told the thoughts in his mind
He wouldnt have dared so far to expose himself to the gaze of his neighbors He kept the little
flame of suspicion to himself It was better if he didnt know anything safer wiser and much
more comfortable As for Cathys mother she was so bound and twisted in a cocoon of gauzy
halflies warped truth suggestions all planted by Cathy that she would not have known a true
thing if it had come to her
Cathy grew more lovely all the time The delicate blooming skin the golden hair the wideset
modest and yet promising eyes the little mouth full of sweetness caught attention and held it
She finished the eight grades of grammar school with such a good record that her parents entered
her in the small high school although in that time it was not usual for a girl to go on with her
studies But Cathy said she wanted to be a teacher which delighted her mother and father for this
was the one profession of dignity open to a girl of a good but not welltodo family Parents took
honor from a daughter who was a teacher
Cathy was fourteen when she entered high school She had always been precious to her parents
but with her entrance into the rarities of algebra and Latin she climbed into clouds where her
parents could not follow They had lost her They felt that she was translated to a higher order
The teacher of Latin was a pale intense young man who had failed in divinity school and yet had
enough education to teach the inevitable grammar Caesar Cicero He was a uiet young man
who warmed his sense of failure to his bosom Deep in himself he felt that he had been rejected
by God and for cause
For a time it was noticed that a flame leaped in James Grew and some force glowed in his eyes
He was never seen with Cathy and no relationship was even suspected
James Grew became a man He walked on his toes and sang to himself He wrote letters so
persuasive that the directors of his divinity school looked favorably on readmitting him
And then the flame went out His shoulders held so high and suare folded dejectedly His eyes
grew feverish and his hands twitched He was seen in church at night on his knees moving his
lips over prayers He missed school and sent word that he was ill when it was known that he was
walking all alone in the hills beyond the town
One night late he tapped on the door of the Ames house Mr Ames complained his way out of
bed lighted a candle flung an overcoat over his nightgown and went to the door It was a wild
and crazylooking James Grew who stood before him his eyes shining and his body one big
shudder
Ive got to see you he said hoarsely to Mr Ames
Its after midnight Mr Ames said sternly
Ive got to see you alone Put on some clothes and come outside Ive got to talk to you
Young man I think youre drunk or sick Go home and get some sleep Its after midnight
I cant wait Ive got to talk to you
Come down to the tannery in the morning said Mr Ames and he closed the door firmly on the
reeling caller and stood inside listening He heard the wailing voice I cant wait I cant wait
and then the feet dragged slowly down the steps
Mr Ames shielded the candlelight away from his eyes with his cupped hand and went back to
bed He thought he saw Cathys door close very silently but perhaps the leaping candlelight had
fooled his eyes for a portiere seemed to move too
What in the world his wife demanded when he came back to the bedside
Mr Ames didnt know why he answered as he didperhaps to save discussion A drunken
man he said Got the wrong house
I dont know what the world is coming to said Mrs Ames
As he lay in the darkness after the light was out he saw the green circle left in his eyes by the
candle flame and in its whirling pulsing frame he saw the frantic beseeching eyes of James
Grew He didnt go back to sleep for a long time
In the morning a rumor ran through the town distorted here and there added to but by afternoon
the story clarified The sexton had found James Grew stretched on the floor in front of the altar
The whole top of his head was blown off Beside him lay a shotgun and beside it the piece of
stick with which he had pushed the trigger Near him on the floor was a candlestick from the
altar One of the three candles was still burning The other two had not been lighted And on the
floor were two books the hymnal and the Book of Common Prayer one on top of the other The
way the sexton figured it James Grew had propped the gun barrel on the books to bring it in line
with his temple The recoil of the discharge had thrown the shotgun off the books
A number of people remembered having heard an explosion early in the morning before
daylight James Grew left no letter No one could figure why he had done it
Mr Ames first impulse was to go to the coroner with his story of the midnight call Then he
thought What good would it do If I knew anything it would be different But I dont know a
single thing He had a sick feeling in his stomach He told himself over and over that it was not
his fault How could I have helped it I dont even know what he wanted He felt guilty and
miserable
At dinner his wife talked about the suicide and he couldnt eat Cathy sat silent but no more
silent than usual She ate with little dainty nips and wiped her mouth often on her napkin
Mrs Ames went over the matter of the body and the gun in detail Theres one thing I meant to
speak of she said That drunken man who came to the door last nightcould that have been
young Grew
No he said uickly
Are you sure Could you see him in the dark
I had a candle he said sharply Didnt look anything like had a big beard
No need to snap at me she said I just wondered
Cathy wiped her mouth and when she laid the napkin on her lap she was smiling
Mrs Ames turned to her daughter You saw him every day in school Cathy Has he seemed sad
lately Did you notice anything that might mean
Cathy looked down at her plate and then up I thought he was sick she said Yes he has
looked bad Everybody was talking in school today And somebodyI dont remember who
said that Mr Grew was in some kind of trouble in Boston I didnt hear what kind of trouble We
all liked Mr Grew She wiped her lips delicately
That was Cathys method Before the next day was out everybody in town knew that James Grew
had been in trouble in Boston and no one could possibly imagine that Cathy had planted the
story Even Mrs Ames had forgotten where she heard it
Soon after her sixteenth birthday a change came over Cathy One morning she did not get up for
school Her mother went into her room and found her in bed staring at the ceiling Hurry youll
be late Its nearly nine
Im not going There was no emphasis in her voice
Are you sick
Then hurry get up
Im not going
You must be sick Youve never missed a day
Im not going to school Cathy said calmly Im never going to school again
Her mothers mouth fell open What do you mean
Not ever said Cathy and continued to stare at the ceiling
Well well just see what your father has to say about that With all our work and expense and
two years before you get your certificate Then she came close and said softly You arent
thinking of getting married
Whats that book youre hiding
Here Im not hiding it
Oh Alice in Wonderland Youre too big for that
Cathy said I can get to be so little you cant even see me
What in the world are you talking about
Nobody can find me
Her mother said angrily Stop making jokes I dont know what youre thinking of What does
Miss Fancy think she is going to do
I dont know yet said Cathy I think Ill go away
Well you just lie there Miss Fancy and when your father comes home hell have a thing or two
to say to you
Cathy turned her head very slowly and looked at her mother Her eyes were expressionless and
cold And suddenly Mrs Ames was afraid of her daughter She went out uietly and closed the
door In her kitchen she sat down and cupped her hands in her lap and stared out the window at
the weathering carriage house
Her daughter had become a stranger to her She felt as most parents do at one time or another
that she was losing control that the bridle put in her hands for the governing of Cathy was
slipping through her fingers She did not know that she had never had any power over Cathy She
had been used for Cathys purposes always After a while Mrs Ames put on a bonnet and went to
the tannery She wanted to talk to her husband away from the house
In the afternoon Cathy rose listlessly from her bed and spent a long time in front of the mirror
That evening Mr Ames hating what he had to do delivered a lecture to his daughter He spoke
of her duty her obligation her natural love for her parents Toward the end of his speech he was
aware that she was not listening to him This made him angry and he fell into threats He spoke of
the authority God had given him over his child and of how this natural authority had been armed
by the state He had her attention now She looked him right in the eyes Her mouth smiled a
little and her eyes did not seem to blink Finally he had to look away and this enraged him
further He ordered her to stop her nonsense Vaguely he threatened her with whipping if she did
not obey him
He ended on a note of weakness I want you to promise me that you will go to school in the
morning and stop your foolishness
Her face was expressionless The little mouth was straight All right she said
Later that night Mr Ames said to his wife with an assurance he did not feel You see it just
needs a little authority Maybe weve been too lax But she has been a good child I guess she just
forgot whos boss A little sternness never hurt anybody He wished he were as confident as his
words
In the morning she was gone Her straw traveling basket was gone and the best of her clothing
Her bed was neatly made The room was impersonalnothing to indicate that a girl had grown
up in it There were no pictures no mementos none of the normal clutter of growing Cathy had
never played with dolls The room had no Cathy imprint
In his way Mr Ames was an intelligent man He clapped on his derby hat and walked uickly to
the railroad station The station agent was certain Cathy had taken the early morning train She
had bought a ticket for Boston He helped Mr Ames write a telegram to the Boston police Mr
Ames bought a roundtrip ticket and caught the ninefifty train to Boston He was a very good
man in a crisis
That night Mrs Ames sat in the kitchen with the door closed She was white and she gripped the
table with her hands to control her shaking The sound first of the blows and then of the
screaming came clearly to her through the closed doors
Mr Ames was not good at whipping because he had never done it He lashed at Cathys legs with
the buggy whip and when she stood uietly staring at him with calm cold eyes he lost his temper
The first blows were tentative and timid but when she did not cry he slashed at her sides and
shoulders The whip licked and cut In his rage he missed her several times or got too close so
that the whip wrapped around her body
Cathy learned uickly She found him out and knew him and once she had learned she screamed
she writhed she cried she begged and she had the satisfaction of feeling the blows instantly
become lighter
Mr Ames was frightened at the noise and hurt he was creating He stopped Cathy dropped back
on the bed sobbing And if he had looked her father would have seen that there were no tears in
her eyes but rather the muscles of her neck were tight and there were lumps just under her
temples where the jaw muscles knotted
He said Now will you ever do that again
No oh no Forgive me Cathy said She turned over on the bed so that her father could not see
the coldness in her face
See you remember who you are And dont forget what I am
Cathys voice caught She produced a dry sob I wont forget she said
In the kitchen Mrs Ames wrestled her hands Her husband put his fingers on her shoulder
I hated to do it he said I had to And I think it did her good She seems like a changed girl to
me Maybe we havent bent the twig enough Weve spared the rod Maybe we were wrong
And he knew that although his wife had insisted on the whipping although she had forced him
to whip Cathy she hated him for doing it Despair settled over him
There seemed no doubt that it was what Cathy needed As Mr Ames said It kind of opened her
up She had always been tractable but now she became thoughtful too In the weeks that
followed she helped her mother in the kitchen and offered to help more than was needed She
started to knit an afghan for her mother a large project that would take months Mrs Ames told
the neighbors about it She has such a fine color senserust and yellow Shes finished three
suares already
For her father Cathy kept a ready smile She hung up his hat when he came in and turned his
chair properly under the light to make it easy for him to read
Even in school she was changed Always she had been a good student but now she began to
make plans for the future She talked to the principal about examinations for her teaching
certificate perhaps a year early And the principal looked over her record and thought she might
well try it with hope of success He called on Mr Ames at the tannery to discuss it
She didnt tell us any of this Mr Ames said proudly
Well maybe I shouldnt have told you I hope I havent ruined a surprise
Mr and Mrs Ames felt that they had blundered on some magic which solved all of their
problems They put it down to an unconscious wisdom which comes only to parents I never saw
such a change in a person in my life Mr Ames said
But she was always a good child said his wife And have you noticed how pretty shes
getting Why shes almost beautiful Her cheeks have so much color
I dont think shell be teaching school long with her looks said Mr Ames
It was true that Cathy glowed The childlike smile was constantly on her lips while she went
about her preparations She had all the time in the world She cleaned the cellar and stuffed
papers all around the edges of the foundation to block the draft When the kitchen door sueaked
she oiled the hinges and then the lock that turned too hard and while she had the oil can out she
oiled the frontdoor hinges too She made it her duty to keep the lamps filled and their chimneys
clean She invented a way of dipping the chimneys in a big can of kerosene she had in the
basement
Youd have to see it to believe it her father said And it wasnt only at home either She braved
the smell of the tannery to visit her father She was just past sixteen and of course he thought of
her as a baby He was amazed at her uestions about business
Shes smarter than some men I could name he told his foreman She might be running the
business someday
She was interested not only in the tanning processes but in the business end too Her father
explained the loans the payments the billing and the payroll He showed her how to open the
safe and was pleased that after the first try she remembered the combination
The way I look at it is this he told his wife Weve all of us got a little of the Old Nick in us I
wouldnt want a child that didnt have some gumption The way I see it thats just a kind of
energy If you just check it and keep it in control why it will go in the right direction
Cathy mended all of her clothes and put her things in order
One day in May she came home from school and went directly to her knitting needles Her
mother was dressed to go out I have to go to the Altar Guild she said Its about the cake sale
next week Im chairman Your father wondered if you would go by the bank and pick up the
money for the payroll and take it to the tannery I told him about the cake sale so I cant do it
Id like to said Cathy
Theyll have the money ready for you in a bag said Mrs Ames and she hurried out
Cathy worked uickly but without hurry She put on an old apron to cover her clothes In the
basement she found a jelly jar with a top and carried it out to the carriage house where the tools
were kept In the chickenyard she caught a little pullet took it to the block and chopped its head
off and held the writhing neck over the jelly jar until it was full of blood Then she carried the
uivering pullet to the manure pile and buried it deep Back in the kitchen she took off the apron
and put it in the stove and poked the coals until a flame sprang up on the cloth She washed her
hands and inspected her shoes and stockings and wiped a dark spot from the toe of her right shoe
She looked at her face in the mirror Her cheeks were bright with color and her eyes shone and
her mouth turned up in its small childlike smile On her way out she hid the jelly jar under the
lowest part of the kitchen steps Her mother had not been gone even ten minutes
Cathy walked lightly almost dancingly around the house and into the street The trees were
breaking into leaf and a few early dandelions were in yellow flower on the lawns Cathy walked
gaily toward the center of the town where the bank was And she was so fresh and pretty that
people walking turned and looked after her when she had passed
The fire broke out at about three oclock in the morning It rose flared roared crashed and
crumbled in on itself almost before anyone noticed it When the volunteers ran up pulling their
hose cart there was nothing for them to do but wet down the roofs of the neighboring houses to
keep them from catching fire
The Ames house had gone up like a rocket The volunteers and the ordinary audience fires attract
looked around at the lighted faces trying to see Mr and Mrs Ames and their daughter It came to
everyone at once that they were not there People gazed at the broad emberbed and saw
themselves and their children in there and hearts rose up and pumped against throats The
volunteers began to dump water on the fire almost as though they might even so late save some
corporeal part of the family The frightened talk ran through the town that the whole Ames family
had burned
By sunrise everyone in town was tightpacked about the smoking black pile Those in front had to
shield their faces against the heat The volunteers continued to pump water to cool off the charred
mess By noon the coroner was able to throw wet planks down and probe with a crowbar among
the sodden heaps of charcoal Enough remained of Mr and Mrs Ames to make sure there were
two bodies Near neighbors pointed out the approximate place where Cathys room had been but
although the coroner and any number of helpers worked over the debris with a garden rake they
could find no tooth or bone
The chief of the volunteers meanwhile had found the doorknobs and lock of the kitchen door He
looked at the blackened metal puzzled but not uite knowing what puzzled him He borrowed
the coroners rake and worked furiously He went to the place where the front door had been and
raked until he found that lock crooked and half melted By now he had his own small crowd
who demanded What are you looking for George And What did you find George
Finally the coroner came over to him Whats on your mind George
No keys in the locks the chief said uneasily
Maybe they fell out
Maybe they melted
The locks didnt melt
Maybe Bill Ames took them out
On the inside He held up his trophies Both bolts stuck out
Since the owners house was burned and the owner ostensibly burned with it the employees of
the tannery out of respect did not go to work They hung around the burned house offering to
help in any way they could feeling official and generally getting in the way
It wasnt until afternoon that Joel Robinson the foreman went down to the tannery He found the
safe open and papers scattered all over the floor A broken window showed how the thief had
entered
Now the whole complexion changed So it was not an accident Fear took the place of
excitement and sorrow and anger brother of fear crept in The crowd began to spread
They had not far to go In the carriage house there was what is called signs of a strugglein
this case a broken box a shattered carriage lamp scraped marks in the dust and straw on the
floor The onlookers might not have known these as signs of a struggle had there not been a
uantity of blood on the floor
The constable took control This was his province He pushed and herded everyone out of the
carriage house Want to gum up all the clues he shouted at them Now you all stay clear
outside the door
He searched the room picked up something and in a corner found something else He came to
the door holding his discoveries in his handsa bloodsplattered blue hair ribbon and a cross
with red stones Anybody recognize these here he demanded
In a small town where everyone knows everyone it is almost impossible to believe that one of
your acuaintance could murder anyone For that reason if the signs are not pretty strong in a
particular direction it must be some dark stranger some wanderer from the outside world where
such things happen Then the hobo camps are raided and vagrants brought in and hotel registers
scrutinized Every man who is not known is automatically suspected It was May remember and
the wandering men had only recently taken to the roads now that the warming months let them
spread their blankets by any water course And the gypsies were out tooa whole caravan less
than five miles away And what a turning out those poor gypsies got
The ground for miles around was searched for newturned earth and likely pools were dragged
for Cathys body She was so pretty everyone said and they meant that in themselves they
could see a reason for carrying Cathy off At length a bumbling hairy halfwit was brought in for
uestioning He was a fine candidate for hanging because not only did he have no alibis he could
not remember what he had done at anytime in his life His feeble mind sensed that these
uestioners wanted something of him and being a friendly creature he tried to give it to them
When a baited and set uestion was offered to him he walked happily into the trap and was glad
when the constable looked happy He tried manfully to please these superior beings There was
something very nice about him The only trouble with his confession was that he confessed too
much in too many directions Also he had constantly to be reminded of what he was supposed to
have done He was really pleased when he was indicted by a stern and frightened jury He felt
that at last he amounted to something
There were and are some men who become judges whose love for the law and for its intention
of promoting justice has the uality of love for a woman Such a man presided at the examination
before pleaa man so pure and good that he canceled out a lot of wickedness with his life
Without the prompting the culprit was used to his confession was nonsense The judge ues
tioned him and found out that although the suspect was trying to follow instructions he simply
could not remember what he had done whom he had killed how or why The judge sighed
wearily and motioned him out of the courtroom and crooked his fingers at the constable
Now look here Mike he said you shouldnt do a thing like that If that poor fellow had been
just a little smarter you might have got him hanged
He said he did it The constables feelings were hurt because he was a conscientious man
He would have admitted climbing the golden stairs and cutting St Peters throat with a bowling
ball the judge said Be more careful Mike The law was designed to save not to destroy
In all such local tragedies time works like a damp brush on water color The sharp edges blur the
ache goes out of it the colors melt together and from the many separated lines a solid gray
emerges Within a month it was not so necessary to hang someone and within two months nearly
everybody discovered that there wasnt any real evidence against anyone If it had not been for
Cathys murder fire and robbery might have been a coincidence Then it occurred to people that
without Cathys body you couldnt prove anything even though you thought she was dead
Cathy left a scent of sweetness behind her
Mr Edwards carried on his business of whoremaster in an orderly and unemotional way He
maintained his wife and his two wellmannered children in a good house in a good neighborhood
in Boston The children two boys were entered on the books at Groton when they were infants
Mrs Edwards kept a dustless house and controlled her servants There were of course many times
when Mr Edwards had to be away from home on business but he managed to live an amazingly
domestic life and to spend more evenings at home than you could imagine He ran his business
with a public accountants neatness and accuracy He was a large and powerful man running a
little to fat in his late forties and yet in surprisingly good condition for a time when a man
wanted to be fat if only to prove he was a success
He had invented his businessthe circuit route through the small towns the short stay of each
girl the discipline the percentages He felt his way along and made few mistakes He never sent
his girls into the cities He could handle the hungry constables of the villages but he had respect
for the experienced and voracious big city police His ideal stand was a small town with a
mortgaged hotel and no amusements one where his only competition came from wives and an
occasional wayward girl At this time he had ten units Before he died at sixtyseven of
strangulation on a chicken bone he had groups of four girls in each of thirtythree small towns in
New England He was better than well fixedhe was rich and the manner of his death was in
itself symbolic of success and wellbeing
At the present time the institution of the whorehouse seems to a certain extent to be dying out
Scholars have various reasons to give Some say that the decay of morality among girls has dealt
the whorehouse its deathblow Others perhaps more idealistic maintain that police supervision
on an increased scale is driving the houses out of existence In the late days of the last century
and the early part of this one the whorehouse was an accepted if not openly discussed institution
It was said that its existence protected decent women An unmarried man could go to one of these
houses and evacuate the sexual energy which was making him uneasy and at the same time
maintain the popular attitudes about the purity and loveliness of women It was a mystery but
then there are many mysterious things in our social thinking
These houses ranged from palaces filled with gold and velvet to the crummiest cribs where the
stench would drive a pig away Every once in a while a story would start about how young girls
were stolen and enslaved by the controllers of the industry and perhaps many of the stories were
true But the great majority of whores drifted into their profession through laziness and stupidity
In the houses they had no responsibility They were fed and clothed and taken care of until they
were too old and then they were kicked out This ending was no deterrent No one who is young
is ever going to be old
Now and then a smart girl came into the profession but she usually moved up to better things
She got a house of her own or worked successfully at blackmail or married a rich man There was
even a special name for the smart ones They were grandly called courtesans
Mr Edwards had no trouble either in recruiting or in controlling his girls If a girl was not
properly stupid he threw her out He did not want very pretty girls either Some local young man
might fall in love with a pretty whore and there would be hell to pay When any of his girls
became pregnant they had the choice of leaving or of being aborted so brutally that a fair
proportion died In spite of this the girls usually chose abortion
It was not always smooth sailing for Mr Edwards He did have his problems At the time of
which I am telling you he had been subjected to a series of misfortunes A train wreck had killed
off two units of four girls each Another of his units he lost to conversion when a smalltown
preacher suddenly caught fire and began igniting the townsfolk with his sermons The swelling
congregation had to move out of the church and into the fields Then as happens so often the
preacher turned over his holecard the surefire card He predicted the date of the end of the
world and the whole county moved bleating in on him Mr Edwards went to the town took the
heavy uirt from his suitcase and whipped the girls unmercifully instead of seeing the thing his
way the girls begged for more whipping to wipe out their fancied sins He gave up in disgust
took their clothes and went back to Boston The girls achieved a certain prominence when they
went naked to the camp meeting to confess and testify That is how Mr Edwards happened to be
interviewing and recruiting numbers of girls instead of picking one up here and there He had
three units to rebuild from the ground
I dont know how Cathy Ames heard about Mr Edwards Perhaps a hack driver told her The
word got around when a girl really wanted to know Mr Edwards had not had a good morning
when she came into his office The pain in his stomach he ascribed to a halibut chowder his wife
had given him for supper the night before He had been up all night The chowder had blown both
ways and he still felt weak and crampy
For this reason he did not take in all at once the girl who called herself Catherine Amesbury She
was far too pretty for his business Her voice was low and throaty she was slight almost delicate
and her skin was lovely In a word she was not Mr Edwards kind of girl at all If he had not been
weak he would have rejected her instantly But while he did not look at her very closely during
the routine uestioning mostly about relatives who might cause trouble something in Mr
Edwards body began to feel her Mr Edwards was not a concupiscent man and besides he never
mixed his professional life with his private pleasures His reaction startled him He looked up
puzzled at the girl and her eyelids dipped sweetly and mysteriously and there was just a
suggestion of a sway on her lightly padded hips Her little mouth wore a cat smile Mr Edwards
leaned forward at his desk breathing heavily He realized that he wanted this one for his own
I cant understand why a girl like you he began and fell right into the oldest conviction in
the worldthat the girl you are in love with cant possibly be anything but true and honest
My father is dead Catherine said modestly Before he died he had let things go to pieces We
didnt know he had borrowed money on the farm And I cant let the bank take it away from my
mother The shock would kill her Catherines eyes dimmed with tears I thought maybe I could
make enough to keep up the interest
If ever Mr Edwards had a chance it was now And indeed a little warning buzz did sound in his
brain but it was not loud enough About eighty per cent of the girls who came to him needed
money to pay off a mortgage And Mr Edwards made it an unvarying rule not to believe
anything his girls said at any time beyond what they had for breakfast and they sometimes lied
about that And here he was a big fat grownup whoremaster leaning his stomach against his
desk while his cheeks darkened with blood and excited chills ran up his legs and thighs
Mr Edwards heard himself saying Well now my dear lets talk this over Maybe we can figure
some way for you to get the interest money And this to a girl who had simply asked for a job as
a whoreor had she
Mrs Edwards was persistently if not profoundly religious She spent a great part of her time
with the mechanics of her church which did not leave her time for either its background or its
effects To her Mr Edwards was in the importing business and even if she had knownwhich
she probably didwhat business he was really in she would not have believed it And this is
another mystery Her husband had always been to her a coldly thoughtful man who made few and
dutiful physical demands on her If he had never been warm he had never been cruel either Her
dramas and her emotions had to do with the boys with the vestry and with food She was content
with her life and thankful When her husbands disposition began to disintegrate causing him to
be restless and snappish to sit staring and then to rush out of the house in a nervous rage she
ascribed it first to his stomach and then to business reverses When by accident she came upon
him in the bathroom sitting on the toilet and crying softly to himself she knew he was a sick
man He tried uickly to cover his red brimming eyes from her scrutiny When neither herb teas
nor physics cured him she was helpless
If in all the years Mr Edwards had heard about anyone like himself he would have laughed For
Mr Edwards as coldblooded a whoremaster as ever lived had fallen hopelessly miserably in
love with Catherine Amesbury He rented a sweet little brick house for her and then gave it to
her He bought her every imaginable luxury overdecorated the house kept it overwarm The
carpeting was too deep and the walls were crowded with heavy framed pictures
Mr Edwards had never experienced such misery As a matter of business he had learned so much
about women that he did not trust one for a second And since he deeply loved Catherine and love
reuires trust he was torn to uivering fragments by his emotion He had to trust her and at the
same time he did not trust her He tried to buy her loyalty with presents and with money When
he was away from her he tortured himself with the thought of other men slipping into her house
He hated to leave Boston to check up on his units because this would leave Catherine alone To a
certain extent he began to neglect his business It was his first experience with this kind of love
and it nearly killed him
One thing Mr Edwards did not know and could not know because Catherine would not permit it
was that she was faithful to him in the sense that she did not receive or visit other men To
Catherine Mr Edwards was as cold a business proposition as his units were to him And as he
had his techniues so had she hers Once she had him which was very soon she managed
always to seem slightly dissatisfied She gave him an impression of restlessness as though she
might take flight at any moment When she knew he was going to visit her she made it a point to
be out and to come in glowing as from some incredible experience She complained a good deal
about the difficulties of avoiding the lecherous looks and touches of men in the street who could
not keep away from her Several times she ran frightened into the house having barely escaped a
man who had followed her When she would return in the late afternoon and find him waiting for
her she would explain Why I was shopping I have to go shopping you know And she made
it sound like a lie
In their sexual relations she convinced him that the result was not uite satisfactory to her that if
he were a better man he could release a flood of unbelievable reaction in her Her method was to
keep him continually off balance She saw with satisfaction his nerves begin to go his hands
take to uivering his loss of weight and the wild glazed look in his eyes And when she
delicately sensed the near approach of insane punishing rage she sat in his lap and soothed him
and made him believe for a moment in her innocence She could convince him
Catherine wanted money and she set about getting it as uickly and as easily as she could When
she had successfully reduced him to a pulp and Catherine knew exactly when the time had come
she began to steal from him She went through his pockets and took any large bills she found He
didnt dare accuse her for fear she would go away The presents of jewelry he gave her
disappeared and although she said she had lost them he knew they had been sold She padded the
grocery bills added to the prices of clothes He could not bring himself to stop it She did not sell
the house but she mortgaged it for every penny she could get
One evening his key did not fit the lock of the front door She answered his pounding after a long
time Yes she had changed the locks because she had lost her key She was afraid living alone
Anyone could get in She would get him another keybut she never did He always had to ring
the bell after that and sometimes it took a long time for her to answer and at other times his ring
was not answered at all There was no way for him to know whether she was at home or not Mr
Edwards had her followedand she did not know how often
Mr Edwards was essentially a simple man but even a simple man has complexities which are
dark and twisted Catherine was clever but even a clever woman misses some of the strange
corridors in a man
She made only one bad slip and she had tried to avoid that one As was proper Mr Edwards had
stocked the pretty little nest with champagne Catherine had from the first refused to touch it
It makes me sick she explained Ive tried it and I cant drink it
Nonsense he said Just have one glass It cant hurt you
No thank you No I cant drink it
Mr Edwards thought of her reluctance as a delicate a ladylike uality He had never insisted
until one evening when it occurred to him that he knew nothing about her Wine might loosen her
tongue The more he thought of it the better the idea seemed to him
Its not friendly of you not to have a glass with me
I tell you it doesnt agree with me
Nonsense
I tell you I dont want it
This is silly he said Do you want me to be angry with you
Then drink a glass
I dont want it
Drink it He held a glass for her and she retreated from it
You dont know Its not good for me
Drink it
She took the glass and poured it down and stood still uivering seeming to listen The blood
flowed to her cheeks She poured another glass for herself and another Her eyes became set and
cold Mr Edwards felt a fear of her Something was happening to her which neither she nor he
could control
I didnt want to do it Remember that she said calmly
Maybe youd better not have any more
She laughed and poured herself another glass It doesnt matter now she said More wont
make much difference
Its nice to have a glass or so he said uneasily
She spoke to him softly You fat slug she said What do you know about me Do you think I
cant read every rotten thought you ever had Want me to tell you You wonder where a nice girl
like me learned tricks Ill tell you I learned them in cribsyou hearcribs Ive worked in
places you never even heard offour years Sailors brought me little tricks from Port Said I
know every nerve in your lousy body and I can use them
Catherine he protested you dont know what youre saying
I could see it You thought I would talk Well Im talking
She advanced slowly toward him and Mr Edwards overcame his impulse to edge away He was
afraid of her but he sat still Directly in front of him she drank the last champagne in her glass
delicately struck the rim on the table and jammed the ragged edge against his cheek
And then he did run from the house and he could hear her laughing as he went
Love to a man like Mr Edwards is a crippling emotion It ruined his judgment canceled his
knowledge weakened him He told himself that she was hysterical and tried to believe it and it
was made easier for him by Catherine Her outbreak had terrified her and for a time she made
every effort to restore his sweet picture of her
A man so painfully in love is capable of selftorture beyond belief Mr Edwards wanted with all
his heart to believe in her goodness but he was forced not to as much by his own particular devil
as by her outbreak Almost instinctively he went about learning the truth and at the same time
disbelieved it He knew for instance that she would not put her money in a bank One of his
employees using a complicated set of mirrors found out the place in the cellar of the little brick
house where she did keep it
One day a clipping came from the agency he employed It was an old newspaper account of a
fire from a smalltown weekly Mr Edwards studied it His chest and stomach turned to molten
metal and a redness glowed in his head behind his eyes There was real fear mixed up in his love
and the precipitate from the mixing of these two is cruelty He staggered dizzily to his office
couch and lay face down his forehead against the cool black leather For a time he hung
suspended hardly breathing Gradually his brain cleared His mouth tasted salty and there was a
great ache of anger in his shoulders But he was calm and his mind cut its intention through time
like the sharp beam of a searchlight through a dark room He moved slowly checking his
suitcase just as he always did when he started out to inspect his unitsclean shirts and
underwear a nightgown and slippers and the heavy uirt with the lash curving around the end of
the suitcase
He moved heavily up the little garden in front of the brick house and rang the bell
Catherine answered it immediately She had on her coat and hat
Oh she said What a shame I must go out for a while
Mr Edwards put down his suitcase No he said
She studied him Something was changed He lumbered past her and went down into the cellar
Where are you going Her voice was shrill
He did not reply In a moment he came up again carrying a small oak box He opened his
suitcase and put the box inside
Thats mine she said softly
What are you up to
I thought wed go for a little trip
Where I cant go
Little town in Connecticut I have some business there You told me once you wanted to work
Youre going to work
I dont want to now You cant make me Why Ill call the police
He smiled so horribly that she stepped back from him His temples were thudding with blood
Maybe youd rather go to your home town he said They had a big fire there several years
ago Do you remember that fire
Her eyes probed and searched him seeking a soft place but his eyes were flat and hard What
do you want me to do she asked uietly
Just come for a little trip with me You said you wanted to work
She could think of only one plan She must go along with him and wait for a chance A man
couldnt always watch It would be dangerous to thwart him nowbest go along with it and wait
That always worked It always had But his words had given Catherine real fear
In the small town they got off the train at dusk walked down its one dark street and on out into
the country Catherine was wary and watchful She had no access to his plan In her purse she had
a thinbladed knife
Mr Edwards thought he knew what he intended to do He meant to whip her and put her in one of
the rooms at the inn whip her and move her to another town and so on until she was of no use
any more Then he would throw her out The local constable would see to it that she did not run
away The knife did not bother him He knew about that
The first thing he did when they stopped in a private place between a stone wall and a fringe of
cedars was to jerk the purse from her hand and throw it over the wall That took care of the knife
But he didnt know about himself because in all his life he had never been in love with a woman
He thought he only meant to punish her After two slashes the uirt was not enough He dropped
it on the ground and used his fists His breathing came out in suealing whines
Catherine did her best not to fall into panic She tried to duck his threshing fists or at least to
make them ineffective but at last fear overcame her and she tried to run He leaped at her and
brought her down and by then his fists were not enough His frantic hand found a stone on the
ground and his cold control was burst through with a red roaring wave
Later he looked down on her beaten face He listened for her heartbeat and could hear nothing
over the thumping of his own Two complete and separate thoughts ran in his mind One said
Have to bury her have to dig a hole and put her in it And the other cried like a child I cant
stand it I couldnt bear to touch her Then the sickness that follows rage overwhelmed him He
ran from the place leaving his suitcase leaving the uirt leaving the oak box of money He
blundered away in the dusk wondering only where he could hide his sickness for a while
No uestion was ever asked of him After a time of sickness to which his wife ministered
tenderly he went back to his business and never again let the insanity of love come near him A
man who cant learn from experience is a fool he said Always afterward he had a kind of fearful
respect for himself He had never known that the impulse to kill was in him
That he had not killed Catherine was an accident Every blow had been intended to crush her She
was a long time unconscious and a long time halfconscious She realized her arm was broken
and that she must find help if she wanted to live Wanting to live forced her to drag herself along
the dark road looking for help She turned in at a gate and almost made the steps of the house
before she fainted The roosters were crowing in the chickenhouse and a gray rim of dawn lay on
the east
When two men live together they usually maintain a kind of shabby neatness out of incipient rage
at each other Two men alone are constantly on the verge of fighting and they know it Adam
Trask had not been home long before the tensions began to build up The brothers saw too much
of each other and not enough of anyone else
For a few months they were busy getting Cyruss money in order and out at interest They
traveled together to Washington to look at the grave good stone and on top an iron star with seal
and a hole on the top in which to insert the stick for a little flag on Decoration Day The brothers
stood by the grave a long time then they went away and they didnt mention Cyrus
If Cyrus had been dishonest he had done it well No one asked uestions about the money But
the subject was on Charles mind
Back on the farm Adam asked him Why dont you buy some new clothes Youre a rich man
You act like youre afraid to spend a penny
I am said Charles
Why
I might have to give it back
Still harping on that If there was anything wrong dont you think wed have heard about it by
now
I dont know said Charles Id rather not talk about it
But that night he brought up the subject again Theres one thing bothers me he began
About the money
Yes about the money If you make that much money theres bound to be a mess
How do you mean
Well papers and account books and bills of sale notes figuringwell we went through
Fathers things and there wasnt none of that
Maybe he burned it up
Maybe he did said Charles
The brothers lived by a routine established by Charles and he never varied it Charles awakened
on the stroke of fourthirty as surely as though the brass pendulum of the clock had nudged him
He was awake in fact a split second before fourthirty His eyes were open and had blinked once
before the high gong struck For a moment he lay still looking up into the darkness and
scratching his stomach Then he reached to the table beside his bed and his hand fell exactly on
the block of sulphur matches lying there His fingers pulled a match free and struck it on the side
of the block The sulphur burned its little blue bead before the wood caught Charles lighted the
candle beside his bed He threw back his blanket and got up He wore long gray underwear that
bagged over his knees and hung loose around his ankles Yawning he went to the door opened
it and called Halfpast four Adam Time to get up Wake up
Adams voice was muffled Dont you ever forget
Its time to get up Charles slipped his legs into his pants and hunched them up over his hips
You dont have to get up he said Youre a rich man You can lay in bed all day
So are you But we still get up before daylight
You dont have to get up Charles repeated But if youre going to farm youd better farm
Adam said ruefully So were going to buy more land so we can do more work
Come off it said Charles Go back to bed if you want to
Adam said I bet you couldnt sleep if you stayed in bed You know what I bet I bet you get up
because you want to and then you take credit for itlike taking credit for six fingers
Charles went into the kitchen and lighted the lamp You cant lay in bed and run a farm he
said and he knocked the ashes through the grate of the stove and tore some paper over the
exposed coals and blew until the flames started
Adam was watching him through the door You wouldnt use a match he said
Charles turned angrily You mind your own goddam business Stop picking at me
All right said Adam I will And maybe my business isnt here
Thats up to you Any time you want to get out you go right ahead
The uarrel was silly but Adam couldnt stop it His voice went on without his willing it making
angry and irritating words Youre damn right Ill go when I want he said This is my place as
much as yours
Then why dont you do some work on it
Oh Lord Adam said What are we fussing about Lets not fuss
I dont want trouble said Charles He scooped lukewarm mush into two bowls and spun them
on the table
The brothers sat down Charles buttered a slice of bread gouged out a knifeful of jam and spread
it over the butter He dug butter for his second slice and left a slop of jam on the butter roll
Goddam it cant you wipe your knife Look at that butter
Charles laid his knife and the bread on the table and placed his hands palm down on either side
You better get off the place he said
Adam got up Id rather live in a pigsty he said and he walked out of the house
It was eight months before Charles saw him again Charles came in from work and found Adam
sloshing water on his hair and face from the kitchen bucket
Hello said Charles How are you
Whered you go
Boston
No place else
No Just looked at the city
The brothers settled back to their old life but each took precautions against anger In a way each
protected the other and so saved himself Charles always the early riser got breakfast ready
before he awakened Adam And Adam kept the house clean and started a set of books on the
farm In this guarded way they lived for two years before their irritation grew beyond control
again
On a winter evening Adam looked up from his account book Its nice in California he said
Its nice in the winter And you can raise anything there
Sure you can raise it But when you got it what are you going to do with it
How about wheat They raise a lot of wheat in California
The rust will get to it said Charles
What makes you so sure Look Charles things grow so fast in California they say you have to
plant and step back uick or youll get knocked down
Charles said Why the hell dont you go there Ill buy you out any time you say
Adam was uiet then but in the morning while he combed his hair and peered in the small mirror
he began it again
They dont have any winter in California he said Its just like spring all the time
I like the winter said Charles
Adam came toward the stove Dont be cross he said
Well stop picking at me How many eggs
Four said Adam
Charles placed seven eggs on top of the warming oven and built his fire carefully of small pieces
of kindling until it burned fiercely He put the skillet down next to the flame His sullenness left
him as he fried the bacon
Adam he said I dont know whether you notice it but it seems like every other word you say
is California Do you really want to go
Adam chuckled Thats what Im trying to figure out he said I dont know Its like getting
up in the morning I dont want to get up but I dont want to stay in bed either
You sure make a fuss about it said Charles
Adam went on Every morning in the army that damned bugle would sound And I swore to God
if I ever got out I would sleep till noon every day And here I get up a halfhour before reveille
Will you tell me Charles what in hell were working for
You cant lay in bed and run a farm said Charles He stirred the hissing bacon around with a
fork
Take a look at it Adam said earnestly Neither one of us has got a chick or a child let alone a
wife And the way were going it dont look like we ever will We dont have time to look around
for a wife And here were figuring to add the Clark place to ours if the price is right What for
Its a damn fine piece said Charles The two of them together would make one of the best
farms in this section Say You thinking of getting married
No And thats what Im talking about Come a few years and well have the finest farm in this
section Two lonely old farts working our tails off Then one of us will die off and the fine farm
will belong to one lonely old fart and then hell die off
What the hell are you talking about Charles demanded Fellow cant get comfortable You
make me itch Get it outwhats on your mind
Im not having any fun said Adam Or anyway Im not having enough Im working too hard
for what Im getting and I dont have to work at all
Well why dont you uit Charles shouted at him Why dont you get the hell out I dont see
any guards holding you Go down to the South Seas and lay in a hammock if thats what you
want
Dont be cross said Adam uietly Its like getting up I dont want to get up and I dont want
to stay down I dont want to stay here and I dont want to go away
You make me itch said Charles
Think about it Charles You like it here
And you want to live here all your life
Jesus I wish I had it that easy What do you suppose is the matter with me
I think youve got knocker fever Come in to the inn tonight and get it cured up
Maybe thats it said Adam But I never took much satisfaction in a whore
Its all the same Charles said You shut your eyes and you cant tell the difference
Some of the boys in the regiment used to keep a suaw around I had one for a while
Charles turned to him with interest Father would turn in his grave if he knew you was suawing
around How was it
Pretty nice Shed wash my clothes and mend and do a little cooking
I mean the otherhow was that
Good Yes good And kind of sweetkind of soft and sweet Kind of gentle and soft
Youre lucky she didnt put a knife in you while you were asleep
She wouldnt She was sweet
Youve got a funny look in your eye I guess you were kind of gone on that suaw
I guess I was said Adam
What happened to her
Smallpox
You didnt get another one
Adams eyes were pained We piled them up like they were logs over two hundred arms and
legs sticking out And we piled brush on top and poured coal oil on
Ive heard they cant stand smallpox
It kills them said Adam Youre burning that bacon
Charles turned uickly back to the stove Itll just be crisp he said I like it crisp He
shoveled the bacon out on a plate and broke the eggs in the hot grease and they jumped and
fluttered their edges to brown lace and made clucking sounds
There was a schoolteacher Charles said Prettiest thing you ever saw Had little tiny feet
Bought all her clothes in New York Yellow hair and you never saw such little feet Sang too in
the choir Everybody took to going to church Damn near stampeded getting into church That
was uite a while ago
Bout the time you wrote about thinking of getting married
Charles grinned I guess so I guess there wasnt a young buck in the county didnt get the
marrying fever
Well you know how it is The women got kind of restless with her here They got together First
thing you knew they had her out I heard she wore silk underwear Too hoity toity School board
had her out halfway through the term Feet no longer than that Showed her ankles too like it was
an accident Always showing her ankles
Did you get to know her Adam asked
No I only went to church Couldnt hardly get in Girl that prettys got no right in a little town
Just makes people uneasy Causes trouble
Adam said Remember that Samuels girl She was real pretty What happened to her
Same thing Just caused trouble She went away I heard shes living in Philadelphia Does
dressmaking I heard she gets ten dollars just for making one dress
Maybe we ought to go away from here Adam said
Charles said Still thinking of California
Charles temper tore in two I want you out of here he shouted I want you to get off the
place Ill buy you or sell you or anything Get out you son of a bitch He stopped I guess I
dont mean that last But goddam it you make me nervous
Ill go said Adam
In three months Charles got a colored picture postcard of the bay at Rio and Adam had written
on the back with a splottery pen Its summer here when its winter there Why dont you come
down
Six months later there was another card from Buenos Aires Dear Charlesmy God this is a big
city They speak French and Spanish both Im sending you a book
But no book came Charles looked for it all the following winter and well into the spring And
instead of the book Adam arrived He was brown and his clothes had a foreign look
How are you Charles asked
Fine Did you get the book
I wonder what happened to it It had pictures
Going to stay
I guess so Ill tell you about that country
I dont want to hear about it said Charles
Christ youre mean said Adam
I can just see it all over again Youll stay around a year or so and then youll get restless and
youll make me restless Well get mad at each other and then well get polite to each otherand
thats worse Then well blow up and youll go away again and then youll come back and well
do it all over again
Adam asked Dont you want me to stay
Hell yes said Charles I miss you when youre not here But I can see how its going to be
just the same
And it was just that way For a while they reviewed old times for a while they recounted the
times when they were apart and finally they relapsed into the long ugly silences the hours of
speechless work the guarded courtesy the flashes of anger There were no boundaries to time so
that it seemed endless passing
On an evening Adam said You know Im going to be thirtyseven Thats half a life
Here it comes said Charles Wasting your life Look Adam could we not have a fight this
time
Well if we run true to form well fight for three or four weeks getting you ready to go away If
youre getting restless couldnt you just go away and save all the trouble
Adam laughed and the tension went out of the room Ive got a pretty smart brother he said
Sure when I get the itch bad enough Ill go without fighting Yes I like that Youre getting
rich arent you Charles
Im doing all right I wouldnt say rich
You wouldnt say you bought four buildings and the inn in the village
No I wouldnt say it
But you did Charles youve made this about the prettiest farm anywhere about Why dont we
build a new housebathtub and running water and a water closet Were not poor people any
more Why they say youre nearly the richest man in this section
We dont need a new house Charles said gruffly You take your fancy ideas away
It would be nice to go to the toilet without going outside
You take your fancy ideas away
Adam was amused Maybe Ill build a pretty little house right over by the woodlot Say how
would that be Then we wouldnt get on each others nerves
I dont want it on the place
The place is half mine
Ill buy you out
But I dont have to sell
Charles eyes blazed Ill burn your goddam house down
I believe you would Adam said suddenly sobered I believe you really would What are you
looking like that for
Charles said slowly Ive thought about it a lot And Ive wanted for you to bring it up I guess
you arent ever going to
You remember when you sent me a telegram for a hundred dollars
You bet I do Saved my life I guess Why
You never paid it back
I must have
You didnt
Adam looked down at the old table where Cyrus had sat knocking on his wooden leg with a
stick And the old oil lamp was hanging over the center of the table shedding its unstable yellow
light from the round Rochester wick
Adam said slowly Ill pay you in the morning
I gave you plenty of time to offer
Sure you did Charles I should have remembered He paused considering and at last he said
You dont know why I needed the money
I never asked
And I never told Maybe I was ashamed I was a prisoner Charles I broke jailI escaped
Charles mouth was open What are you talking about
Im going to tell you I was a tramp and I got taken up for vagrancy and put on a road gangleg
irons at night Got out in six months and picked right up again Thats how they get their roads
built I served three days less than the second six months and then I escapedgot over the
Georgia line robbed a store for clothes and sent you the telegram
I dont believe you Charles said Yes I do You dont tell lies Of course I believe you Why
didnt you tell me
Maybe I was ashamed But Im more ashamed that I didnt pay you
Oh forget it said Charles I dont know why I mentioned it
Good God no Ill pay you in the morning
Ill be damned said Charles My brother a jailbird
You dont have to look so happy
I dont know why said Charles but it makes me kind of proud My brother a jailbird Tell me
this Adamwhy did you wait till just three days before they let you go to make your break
Adam smiled Two or three reasons he said I was afraid if I served out my time why theyd
pick me up again And I figured if I waited till the end they wouldnt expect me to run away
That makes sense said Charles But you said there was one more reason
I guess the other was the most important Adam said and its the hardest to explain I figured I
owed the state six months That was the sentence I didnt feel right about cheating I only
cheated three days
Charles exploded with laughter Youre a crazy son of a bitch he said with affection But you
say you robbed a store
I sent the money back with ten per cent interest Adam said
Charles leaned forward Tell me about the road gang Adam
Sure I will Charles Sure I will
Charles had more respect for Adam after he knew about the prison He felt the warmth for his
brother you can feel only for one who is not perfect and therefore no target for your hatred Adam
took some advantage of it too He tempted Charles
Did you ever think Charles that weve got enough money to do anything we want to do
All right what do we want
We could go to Europe we could walk around Paris
Whats that
Whats what
I thought I heard someone on the stoop
Probably a cat
I guess so Have to kill off some of them pretty soon
Charles we could go to Egypt and walk around the Sphinx
We could stay right here and make some good use of our money And we could get the hell out
to work and make some use of the day Those goddam cats Charles jumped to the door and
yanked it open and said Get Then he was silent and Adam saw him staring at the steps He
moved beside him
A dirty bundle of rags and mud was trying to worm its way up the steps One skinny hand clawed
slowly at the stairs The other dragged helplessly There was a caked face with cracked lips and
eyes peering out of swollen blackened lids The forehead was laid open oozing blood back into
the matted hair
Adam went down the stairs and kneeled beside the figure Give me a hand he said Come on
lets get her in Herelook out for that arm It looks broken
She fainted when they carried her in
Put her in my bed Adam said Now I think you better go for the doctor
Dont you think we better hitch up and take her in
Move her No Are you crazy
Maybe not as crazy as you Think about it a minute
For Gods sake think about what
Two men living alone and theyve got this in their house
Adam was shocked You dont mean it
I mean it all right I think we better take her in Itll be all over the county in two hours How do
you know what she is Howd she get here What happened to her Adam youre taking an
awful chance
Adam said coldly If you dont go now Ill go and leave you here
I think youre making a mistake Ill go but I tell you well suffer for it
Ill do the suffering said Adam You go
After Charles left Adam went to the kitchen and poured hoi water from the teakettle into a basin
In his bedroom he dampened a handkerchief in the water and loosened the caked blood and dirt
on the girls face She reeled up to consciousness and her blue eyes glinted at him His mind went
backit was this room this bed His stepmother was standing over him with a damp cloth in her
hand and he could feel the little running pains as the water cut through And she had said
something over and over He heard it but he could not remember what it was
Youll be all right he said to the girl Were getting a doctor Hell be here right off
Her lips moved a little
Dont try to talk he said Dont try to say anything As he worked gently with his cloth a
huge warmth crept over him You can stay here he said You can stay here as long as you
want Ill take care of you He sueezed out the cloth and sponged her matted hair and lifted it
out of the gashes in her scalp
He could hear himself talking as he worked almost as though he were a stranger listening
There does that hurt The poor eyesIll put some brown paper over your eyes Youll be all
right Thats a bad one on your forehead Im afraid youll have a scar there Could you tell me
your name No dont try Theres lots of time Theres lots of time Do you hear that Thats the
doctors rig Wasnt that uick He moved to the kitchen door In here Doc Shes in here he
called
She was very badly hurt If there had been Xrays in that time the doctor might have found more
injuries than he did As it was he found enough Her left arm and three ribs were broken and her
jaw was cracked Her skull was cracked too and the teeth on the left side were missing Her scalp
was ripped and torn and her forehead laid open to the skull So much the doctor could see and
identify He set her arm taped her ribs and sewed up her scalp With a pipette and an alcohol
flame he bent a glass tube to go through the aperture where a tooth was missing so that she could
drink and take liuid food without moving her cracked jaw He gave her a large shot of morphine
left a bottle of opium pills washed his hands and put on his coat His patient was asleep before
he left the room
In the kitchen he sat down at the table and drank the hot coffee Charles put in front of him
All right what happened to her he asked
How do we know Charles said truculently We found her on our porch If you want to see go
look at the marks on the road where she dragged herself
Know who she is
God no
You go upstairs at the innis she anybody from there
I havent been there lately I couldnt recognize her in that condition anyway
The doctor turned his head toward Adam You ever see her before
Adam shook his head slowly
Charles said harshly Say what you mousing around at
Ill tell you since youre interested That girl didnt fall under a harrow even if she looks that
way Somebody did that to her somebody who didnt like her at all If you want the truth
somebody tried to kill her
Why dont you ask her Charles said
She wont be talking for uite a while Besides her skull is cracked and God knows what that
will do to her What Im getting at is should I bring the sheriff into it
No Adam spoke so explosively that the two looked at him Let her alone Let her rest
Whos going to take care of her
I am said Adam
Now you look here Charles began
Keep out of it
Its my place as much as yours
Do you want me to go
I didnt mean that
Well Ill go if she has to go
The doctor said Steady down What makes you so interested
I wouldnt put a hurt dog out
You wouldnt get mad about it either Are you holding something back Did you go out last
night Did you do it
He was here all night said Charles He snores like a goddam train
Adam said Why cant you let her be Let her get well
The doctor stood up and dusted his hands Adam he said your father was one of my oldest
friends I know you and your family You arent stupid I dont know why you dont recognize
ordinary facts but you dont seem to Have to talk to you like a baby That girl was assaulted I
believe whoever did it tried to kill her If I dont tell the sheriff about it Im breaking the law I
admit I break a few but not that one
Well tell him But dont let him bother her until shes better
Its not my habit to let my patients be bothered the doctor said You still want to keep her
here
Your funeral Ill look in tomorrow Shell sleep Give her water and warm soup through the
tube if she wants it He stalked out
Charles turned on his brother Adam for Gods sake what is this
Let me alone
Whats got into you
Let me aloneyou hear Just let me alone
Christ said Charles and spat on the floor and went restlessly and uneasily to work
Adam was glad he was gone He moved about the kitchen washed the breakfast dishes and
swept the floor When he had put the kitchen to rights he went in and drew a chair up to the bed
The girl snored thickly through the morpnine The swelling was going down on her face but the
eyes were blackened and swollen Adam sat very still looking at her Her set and splintered arm
lay on her stomach but her right arm lay on top of the coverlet the fingers curled like a nest It
was a childs hand almost ä babys hand Adam touched her wrist with his finger and her fingers
moved a little in reflex Her wrist was warm Secretly then as though he were afraid he might be
caught he straightened her hand and touched the little cushion pads on the fingertips Her
fingers were pink and soft but the skin on the back of her hand seemed to have an underbloom
like a pearl Adam chuckled with delight Her breathing stopped and he became electrically alert
then her throat clicked and the rhythmed snoring continued Gently he worked her hand and
arm under the cover before he tiptoed out of the room
For several days Cathy lay in a cave of shock and opium Her skin felt like lead and she moved
very little because of the pain She was aware of movement around her Gradually her head and
her eyes cleared Two young men were with her one occasionally and the other a great deal She
knew that another man who came in was the doctor and there was also a tall lean man who
interested her more than any of the others and the interest grew out of fear Perhaps in her
drugged sleep she had picked something up and stored it
Very slowly her mind assembled the last days and rearranged them She saw the face of Mr
Edwards saw it lose its placid selfsufficiency and dissolve into murder She had never been so
afraid before in her life but she had learned fear now And her mind sniffed about like a rat
looking for an escape Mr Edwards knew about the fire Did anyone else And how did he
know A blind nauseating terror rose in her when she thought of that
From things she heard she learned that the tall man was the sheriff and wanted to uestion her
and that the young man named Adam was protecting her from the uestioning Maybe the sheriff
knew about the fire
Raised voices gave her the cue to her method The sheriff said She must have a name
Somebody must know her
How could she answer Her jaw is broken Adams voice
If shes righthanded she could spell out answers Look here Adam if somebody tried to kill her
Id better catch him while I can Just give me a pencil and let me talk to her
Adam said You heard the doctor say her skull was cracked How do you know she can
remember
Well you give me paper and pencil and well see
I dont want you to bother her
Adam goddam it it doesnt matter what you want Im telling you I want a paper and pencil
Then the other young mans voice Whats the matter with you You make it sound like it was
you who did it Give him a pencil
She had her eyes closed when the three men came uietly into her room
Shes asleep Adam whispered
She opened her eyes and looked at them
The tall man came to the side of the bed I dont want to bother you Miss Im the sheriff I
know you cant talk but will you just write some things on this
She tried to nod and winced with pain She blinked her eyes rapidly to indicate assent
Thats the girl said the sheriff You see She wants to He put the tablet on the bed beside
her and molded her fingers around the pencil There we are Now What is your name
The three men watched her face Her mouth grew thin and her eyes suinted She closed her eyes
and the pencil began to move I dont know it scrawled in huge letters
Here now theres a fresh sheet What do you remember
All black Cant think the pencil wrote before it went over the edge of the tablet
Dont you remember who you are where you came from Think
She seemed to go through a great struggle and then her face gave up and became tragic No
Mixed up Help me
Poor child the sheriff said I thank you for trying anyway When you get better well try
again No you dont have to write any more
The pencil wrote Thank you and fell from her fingers
She had won the sheriff He ranged himself with Adam Only Charles was against her When the
brothers were in her room and it took two of them to help her on the bedpan without hurting her
she studied Charles dark sullenness He had something in his face that she recognized that made
her uneasy She saw that he touched the scar on his forehead very often rubbed it and drew its
outline with his fingers Once he caught her watching He looked guiltily at his fingers Charles
said brutally Dont you worry Youre going to have one like it maybe even a better one
She smiled at him and he looked away When Adam came in with her warm soup Charles said
Im going in town and drink some beer
Adam couldnt remember ever having been so happy It didnt bother him that he did not know
her name She had said to call her Cathy and that was enough for him He cooked for Cathy
going through recipes used by his mother and his stepmother
Cathys vitality was great She began to recover very uickly The swelling went out of her
cheeks and the prettiness of convalescence came to her face In a short time she could be helped
to a sitting position She opened and closed her mouth very carefully and she began to eat soft
foods that reuired little chewing The bandage was still on her forehead but the rest of her face
was little marked except for the hollow cheek on the side where the teeth were missing
Cathy was in trouble and her mind ranged for a way out of it She spoke little even when it was
not so difficult
One afternoon she heard someone moving around in the kitchen She called Adam is it you
Charles voice answered No its me
Would you come in here just a minute please
He stood in the doorway His eyes were sullen
You dont come in much she said
Thats right
You dont like me
I guess thats right too
Will you tell me why
He struggled to find an answer I dont trust you
Why not
I dont know And I dont believe you lost your memory
But why should I lie
I dont know Thats why I dont trust you Theres somethingI almost recognize
You never saw me in your life
Maybe not But theres something that bothers methat I ought to know And how do you
know I never saw you
She was silent and he moved to leave Dont go she said What do you intend to do
About what
About me
He regarded her with a new interest You want the truth
Why else would I ask
I dont know but Ill tell you Im going to get you out of here just as soon as I can My
brothers turned fool but Ill bring him around if I have to lick him
Could you do that Hes a big man
I could do it
She regarded him levelly Where is Adam
Gone in town to get some more of your goddam medicine
Youre a mean man
You know what I think I dont think Im half as mean as you are under that nice skin I think
youre a devil
She laughed softly That makes two of us she said Charles how long do I have
For what
How long before you put me out Tell me truly
All right I will About a week or ten days Soon as you can get around
Suppose I dont go
He regarded her craftily almost with pleasure at the thought of combat All right Ill tell you
When you had all that dope you talked a lot like in your sleep
He laughed for he had seen the uick tightening of her mouth All right dont And if you just
go about your business as soon as you can I wont tell But if you dont youll know all right
and so will the sheriff
I dont believe I said anything bad What could I say
I wont argue with you And Ive got work to do You asked me and I told you
He went outside Back of the henhouse he leaned over and laughed and slapped his leg I
thought she was smarter he said to himself And he felt more easy than he had for days
Charles had frightened her badly And if he had recognized her so had she recognized him He
was the only person she had ever met who played it her way Cathy followed his thinking and it
did not reassure her She knew that her tricks would not work with him and she needed
protection and rest Her money was gone She had to be sheltered and would have to be for a
long time She was tired and sick but her mind went skipping among possibilities
Adam came back from town with a bottle of Pain Killer He poured a tablespoonful This will
taste horrible he said Its good stuff though
She took it without protest did not even make much of a face about it Youre good to me she
said I wonder why Ive brought you trouble
You have not Youve brightened up the whole house Never complain or anything hurt as bad
as you are
Youre so good so kind
I want to be
Do you have to go out Couldnt you stay and talk to me
Sure I could Theres nothing so important to do
Draw up a chair Adam and sit down
When he was seated she stretched her right hand toward him and he took it in both of his So
good and kind she repeated Adam you keep promises dont you
I try to What are you thinking about
Im alone and Im afraid she cried Im afraid
Cant I help you
I dont think anyone can help me
Tell me and let me try
Thats the worst part I cant even tell you
Why not If its a secret I wont tell it
Its not my secret dont you see
No I dont
Her fingers gripped his hand tightly Adam I didnt ever lose my memory
Then why did you say
Thats what Im trying to tell you Did you love your father Adam
I guess I revered him more than loved him
Well if someone you revered were in trouble wouldnt you do anything to save him from
destruction
Well sure I guess I would
Well thats how it is with me
But how did you get hurt
Thats part of it Thats why I cant tell
Was it your father
Oh no But its all tied up together
You mean if you tell me who hurt you then your father will be in trouble
She sighed He would make up the story himself Adam will you trust me
Its an awful thing to ask
No it isnt not if youre protecting your father
You understand its not my secret If it were Id tell you in a minute
Of course I understand Id do the same thing myself
Oh you understand so much Tears welled up in her eyes He leaned down toward her and she
kissed him on the cheek
Dont you worry he said Ill take care of you
She lay back against the pillow I dont think you can
Well your brother doesnt like me He wants me to get out of here
Did he tell you that
Oh no I can just feel it He hasnt your understanding
He has a good heart
I know that but he doesnt have your kindness And when I have to gothe sheriff is going to
begin asking uestions and Ill be all alone
He stared into space My brother cant make you go I own half of this farm I have my own
money
If he wanted me to go I would have to I cant spoil your life
Adam stood up and strode out of the room He went to the back door and looked out on the
afternoon Far off in the field his brother was lifting stones from a sled and piling them on the
stone wall Adam looked up at the sky A blanket of herring clouds was rolling in from the east
He sighed deeply and his breath made a tickling exciting feeling in his chest His ears seemed
suddenly clear so that he heard the chickens cackling and the east wind blowing over the ground
He heard horses hoofs plodding on the road and faroff pounding on wood where a neighbor was
shingling a barn And all these sounds related into a kind of music His eyes were clear too
Fences and walls and sheds stood staunchly out in the yellow afternoon and they were related
too There was change in everything A flight of sparrows dropped into the dust and scrabbled for
bits of food and then flew off like a gray scarf twisting in the light Adam looked back at his
brother He had lost track of time and he did not know how long he had been standing in the
doorway
No time had passed Charles was still struggling with the same large stone And Adam had not
released the full held breath he had taken when time stopped
Suddenly he knew joy and sorrow felted into one fabric Courage and fear were one thing too He
found that he had started to hum a droning little tune He turned walked through the kitchen and
stood in the doorway looking at Cathy She smiled weakly at him and he thought What a child
What a helpless child and a surge of love filled him
Will you marry me he asked
Her face tightened and her hand closed convulsively
You dont have to tell me now he said I want you to think about it But if you would marry
me I could protect you No one could hurt you again
Cathy recovered in an instant Come here Adam There sit down Here give me your hand
Thats good thats right She raised his hand and put the back of it against her cheek My
dear she said brokenly Oh my dear Look Adam you have trusted me Now will you promise
me something Will you promise not to tell your brother you have asked me
Asked you to marry me Why shouldnt I
Its not that I want this night to think Ill want maybe more than this night Could you let me do
that She raised her hand to her head You know Im not sure I can think straight And I want
to
Do you think you might marry me
Please Adam Let me alone to think Please my dear
He smiled and said nervously Dont make it long Im kind of like a cat up a tree so far he cant
come down
Just let me think And Adamyoure a kind man
He went outside and walked toward where his brother was loading stones
When he was gone Cathy got up from her bed and moved unsteadily to the bureau She leaned
forward and looked at her face The bandage was still on her forehead She raised the edge of it
enough to see the angry red underneath She had not only made up her mind to marry Adam but
she had so decided before he had asked her She was afraid She needed protection and money
Adam could give her both And she could control himshe knew that She did not want to be
married but for the time being it was a refuge Only one thing bothered her Adam had a warmth
toward her which she did not understand since she had none toward him nor had ever
experienced it toward anyone And Mr Edwards had really frightened her That had been the
only time in her life she had lost control of a situation She determined never to let it happen
again She smiled to herself when she thought what Charles would say She felt a kinship to
Charles She didnt mind his suspicion of her
Charles straightened up when Adam approached He put his palms against the small of his back
and massaged the tired muscles My God theres lots of rocks he said
Fellow in the army told me theres valleys in Californiamiles and milesand you cant find
a stone not even a little one
Therell be something else said Charles I dont think theres any farm without something
wrong with it Out in the Middle West its locusts someplace else its tornadoes Whats a few
stones
I guess youre right I thought I would give you a hand
Thats nice of you I thought youd spend the rest of your life holding hands with that in there
How long is she going to stay
Adam was on the point of telling him of his proposal but the tone of Charles voice made him
change his mind
Say Charles said Alex Platt came by a little while ago Youd never think what happened to
him Hes found a fortune
Well you know the place on his property where that clump of cedars sticks outyou know
right on the county road
I know What about it
Alex went in between those trees and his stone wall He was hunting rabbits He found a
suitcase and a mans clothes all packed nice Soaked up with rain though Looked like it had
been there some time And there was a wooden box with a lock and when he broke it open there
was near four thousand dollars in it And he found a purse too There wasnt anything in it
No name or anything
Thats the strange partno name no name on the clothes no labels on the suits Its just like
the fellow didnt want to be traced
Is Alex going to keep it
He took it in to the sheriff and the sheriff is going to advertise it and if nobody answers Alex
can keep it
Somebodys sure to claim it
I guess so I didnt tell Alex that Hes feeling so good about it Thats funny about no labels
not cut out just didnt have any
Thats a lot of money Adam said Somebodys bound to claim it
Alex hung around for a while You know his wife goes around a lot Charles was silent
Adam he said finally we got to have a talk The whole countys doing plenty of talking
What about What do you mean
Goddam it about thatthat girl Two men cant have a girl living with them Alex says the
women are pretty riled up about it Adam we cant have it We live here Weve got a good
name
You want me to throw her out before shes well
I want you to get rid of herget her out I dont like her
You never have
I know it I dont trust her Theres somethingsomethingI dont know what it is but I dont
like it When you going to get her out
Tell you what Adam said slowly Give her one more week and then Ill do something about
her
You promise
Sure I promise
Well thats something Ill get the word to Alexs wife From there on shell handle the news
Good Lord Ill be glad to have the house to ourselves again I dont suppose her memorys come
back
No said Adam
Five days later when Charles had gone to buy some calf feed Adam drove the buggy to the
kitchen steps He helped Cathy in tucked a blanket around her knees and put another around her
shoulders He drove to the county seat and was married to her by a justice of the peace
Charles was home when they returned He looked sourly at them when they came into the
kitchen I thought youd took her in to put her on the train
We got married Adam said simply
Cathy smiled at Charles
Why Why did you do it
Why not Cant a man get married
Cathy went uickly into the bedroom and closed the door
Charles began to rave Shes no damn good I tell you Shes a whore
Charles
I tell you shes just a twobit whore I wouldnt trust her with a bit piecewhy that bitch that
slut
Charles stop it Stop it I tell you You keep your filthy mouth shut about my wife
Shes no more a wife than an alley cat
Adam said slowly I think youre jealous Charles I think you wanted to marry her
Why you goddam fool Me jealous I wont live in the same house with her
Adam said evenly You wont have to Im going away You can buy me out if you want You
can have the farm You always wanted it You can stay here and rot
Charles voice lowered Wont you get rid of her Please Adam Throw her out Shell tear you
to pieces Shell destroy you Adam shell destroy you
How do you know so much about her
Charles eyes were bleak I dont he said and his mouth snapped shut
Adam did not even ask Cathy whether she wanted to come out for dinner He carried two plates
into the bedroom and sat beside her
Were going to go away he said Let me go away Please let me I dont want to make you
hate your brother I wonder why he hates me
I think hes jealous
Her eyes narrowed Jealous
Thats what it looks like to me You dont have to worry Were getting out Were going to
California
She said uietly I dont want to go to California
Nonsense Why its nice there sun all the time and beautiful
I dont want to go to California
You are my wife he said softly I want you to go with me
She was silent and did not speak of it again
They heard Charles slam out the door and Adam said That will be good for him Hell get a
little drunk and hell feel better
Cathy modestly looked at her fingers Adam I cant be a wife to you until Im well
I know he said I understand Ill wait
But I want you to stay with me Im afraid of Charles He hates me so
Ill bring my cot in here Then you can call me if youre frightened You can reach out and touch
Youre so good she said Could we have some tea
Why sure Id like some myself He brought the steaming cups in and went back for the sugar
bowl He settled himself in a chair near her bed Its pretty strong Is it too strong for you
I like it strong
He finished his cup Does it taste strange to you Its got a funny taste
Her hand flew to her mouth Oh let me taste it She sipped the dregs Adam she cried you
got the wrong cupthat was mine It had my medicine in it
He licked his lips I guess it cant hurt me
No it cant She laughed softly I hope I dont need to call you in the night
Well you drank my sleeping medicine Maybe you wouldnt wake up easily
Adam went down into a heavy opium sleep though he fought to stay awake Did the doctor tell
you to take this much he asked thickly
Youre just not used to it she said
Charles came back at eleven oclock Cathy heard his tipsy footsteps He went into his room
flung off his clothes and got into bed He grunted and turned trying to get comfortable and then
he opened his eyes Cathy was standing by his bed What do you want
What do you think Move over a little
Wheres Adam
He drank my sleeping medicine by mistake Move over a little
He breathed harshly I already been with a whore
Youre a pretty strong boy Move over a little
How about your broken arm
Ill take care of that Its not your worry
Suddenly Charles laughed The poor bastard he said and he threw back the blanket to receive
You can see how this book has reached a great boundary that was called  Another hundred
years were ground up and churned and what had happened was all muddied by the way folks
wanted it to bemore rich and meaningful the farther back it was In the books of some
memories it was the best time that ever sloshed over the worldthe old time the gay time sweet
and simple as though time were young and fearless Old men who didnt know whether they
were going to stagger over the boundary of the century looked forward to it with distaste For the
world was changing and sweetness was gone and virtue too Worry had crept on a corroding
world and what was lostgood manners ease and beauty Ladies were not ladies any more and
you couldnt trust a gentlemans word
There was a time when people kept their fly buttons fastened And mans freedom was boiling
off And even childhood was no good any morenot the way it was No worry then but how to
find a good stone not round exactly but flattened and watershaped to use in a sling pouch cut
from a discarded shoe Where did all the good stones go and all simplicity
A mans mind vagued up a little for how can you remember the feel of pleasure or pain or
choking emotion You can remember only that you had them An elder man might truly recall
through water the delicate doctortesting of little girls but such a man forgets and wants to the
acid emotion eating at the spleen so that a boy had to put his face flat down in the young wild
oats and drum his fists against the ground and sob Christ Christ Such a man might say and
did Whats that damned kid lying out there in the grass for Hell catch a cold
Oh strawberries dont taste as they used to and the thighs of women have lost their clutch
And some men eased themselves like setting hens into the nest of death
History was secreted in the glands of a million historians We must get out of this bangedup
century some said out of this cheating murderous century of riot and secret death of scrabbling
for public lands and damn well getting them by any means at all
Think back recall our little nation fringing the oceans torn with complexities too big for its
britches Just got going when the British took us on again We beat them but it didnt do us much
good What we had was a burned White House and ten thousand widows on the public pension
list
Then the soldiers went to Mexico and it was a kind of painful picnic Nobody knows why you go
to a picnic to be uncomfortable when it is so easy and pleasant to eat at home The Mexican War
did two good things though We got a lot of western land damn near doubled our size and
besides that it was a training ground for generals so that when the sad selfmurder settled on us
the leaders knew the techniues for making it properly horrible
And then the arguments
Can you keep a slave
Well if you bought him in good faith why not
Next theyll be saying a man cant have a horse Who is it wants to take my property
And there we were like a man scratching at his own face and bleeding into his own beard
Well that was over and we got slowly up off the bloody ground and started westward
There came boom and bust bankruptcy depression
Great public thieves came along and picked the pockets of everyone who had a pocket
To hell with that rotten century
Lets get it over and the door closed shut on it Lets close it like a book and go on reading New
chapter new life A man will have clean hands once we get the lid slammed shut on that stinking
century Its a fair thing ahead Theres no rot on this clean new hundred years Its not stacked
and any bastard who deals seconds from this new deck of yearswhy well crucify him head
down over a privy
Oh but strawberries will never taste so good again and the thighs of women have lost their clutch
Sometimes a kind of glory lights up the mind of a man It happens to nearly everyone You can
feel it growing or preparing like a fuse burning toward dynamite It is a feeling in the stomach a
delight of the nerves of the forearms The skin tastes the air and every deepdrawn breath is
sweet Its beginning has the pleasure of a great stretching yawn it flashes in the brain and the
whole world glows outside your eyes A man may have lived all of his life in the gray and the
land and trees of him dark and somber The events even the important ones may have trooped by
faceless and pale And thenthe gloryso that a cricket song sweetens his ears the smell of the
earth rises chanting to his nose and dappling light under a tree blesses his eyes Then a man
pours outward a torrent of him and yet he is not diminished And I guess a mans importance in
the world can be measured by the uality and number of his glories It is a lonely thing but it
relates us to the world It is the mother of all creativeness and it sets each man separate from all
other men
I dont know how it will be in the years to come There are monstrous changes taking place in the
world forces shaping a future whose face we do not know Some of these forces seem evil to us
perhaps not in themselves but because their tendency is to eliminate other things we hold good It
is true that two men can lift a bigger stone than one man A group can build automobiles uicker
and better than one man and bread from a huge factory is cheaper and more uniform When our
food and clothing and housing all are born in the complication of mass production mass method
is bound to get into our thinking and to eliminate all other thinking In our time mass or
collective production has entered our economics our politics and even our religion so that some
nations have substituted the idea collective for the idea God This in my time is the danger There
is great tension in the world tension toward a breaking point and men are unhappy and confused
At such a time it seems natural and good to me to ask myself these uestions What do I believe
in What must I fight for and what must I fight against
Our species is the only creative species and it has only one creative instrument the individual
mind and spirit of a man Nothing was ever created by two men There are no good
collaborations whether in music in art in poetry in mathematics in philosophy Once the
miracle of creation has taken place the group can build and extend it but the group never invents
anything The preciousness lies in the lonely mind of a man
And now the forces marshaled around the concept of the group have declared a war of
extermination on that preciousness the mind of man By disparagement by starvation by
repressions forced direction and the stunning hammerblows of conditioning the free roving
mind is being pursued roped blunted drugged It is a sad suicidal course our species seems to
have taken
And this I believe that the free exploring mind of the individual human is the most valuable
thing in the world And this I would fight for the freedom of the mind to take any direction it
wishes undirected And this I must fight against any idea religion or government which limits
or destroys the individual This is what I am and what I am about I can understand why a system
built on a pattern must try to destroy the free mind for this is one thing which can by inspection
destroy such a system Surely I can understand this and I hate it and I will fight against it to
preserve the one thing that separates us from the uncreative beasts If the glory can be killed we
are lost
Adam Trask grew up in grayness and the curtains of his life were like dusty cobwebs and his
days a slow file of halfsorrows and sick dissatisfactions and then through Cathy the glory came
to him
It doesnt matter that Cathy was what I have called a monster Perhaps we cant understand
Cathy but on the other hand we are capable of many things in all directions of great virtues and
great sins And who in his mind has not probed the black water
Maybe we all have in us a secret pond where evil and ugly things germinate and grow strong But
this culture is fenced and the swimming brood climbs up only to fall back Might it not be that in
the dark pools of some men the evil grows strong enough to wriggle over the fence and swim
free Would not such a man be our monster and are we not related to him in our hidden water It
would be absurd if we did not understand both angels and devils since we invented them
Whatever Cathy may have been she set off the glory in Adam His spirit rose flying and released
him from fear and bitterness and rancid memories The glory lights up the world and changes it
the way a star shell changes a battleground Perhaps Adam did not see Cathy at all so lighted was
she by his eyes Burned in his mind was an image of beauty and tenderness a sweet and holy girl
precious beyond thinking clean and loving and that image was Cathy to her husband and
nothing Cathy did or said could warp Adams Cathy
She said she did not want to go to California and he did not listen because his Cathy took his arm
and started first So bright was his glory that he did not notice the sullen pain in his brother did
not see the glinting in his brothers eyes He sold his share of the farm to Charles for less than it
was worth and with that and his half of his fathers money he was free and rich
The brothers were strangers now They shook hands at the station and Charles watched the train
pull out and rubbed his scar He went to the inn drank four uick whiskies and climbed the stairs
to the top floor He paid the girl and then could not perform He cried in her arms until she put
him out He raged at his farm forced it added to it drilled and trimmed and his boundaries
extended He took no rest no recreation and he became rich without pleasure and respected
without friends
Adam stopped in New York long enough to buy clothes for himself and Cathy before they
climbed on the train which bore them across the continent How they happened to go to the
Salinas Valley is very easy to understand
In that day the railroadsgrowing fighting among themselves striving to increase and to
dominateused every means to increase their traffic The companies not only advertised in the
newspapers they issued booklets and broadsides describing and picturing the beauty and
richness of the West No claim was too extravagantwealth was unlimited The Southern Pacific
Railroad headed by the wild energy of Leland Stanford had begun to dominate the Pacific
Coast not only in transportation but in politics Its rails extended down the valleys New towns
sprang up new sections were opened and populated for the company had to create customers to
get custom
The long Salinas Valley was part of the exploitation Adam had seen and studied a fine color
broadside which set forth the valley as that region which heaven unsuccessfully imitated After
reading the literature anyone who did not want to settle in the Salinas Valley was crazy
Adam did not rush at his purchase He bought a rig and drove around meeting the earlier comers
talking of soil and water climate and crops prices and facilities It was not speculation with
Adam He was here to settle to found a home a family perhaps a dynasty
Adam drove exuberantly from farm to farm picked up dirt and crumbled it in his fingers talked
and planned and dreamed The people of the valley liked him and were glad he had come to live
there for they recognized a man of substance
He had only one worry and that was for Cathy She was not well She rode around the country
with him but she was listless One morning she complained of feeling ill and stayed in her room
in the King City hotel while Adam drove into the country He returned at about five in the
afternoon to find her nearly dead from loss of blood Luckily Adam found Dr Tilson at his
supper and dragged him from his roast beef The doctor made a uick examination inserted a
packing and turned to Adam
Why dont you wait downstairs he suggested
Is she all right
Yes Ill call you pretty soon
Adam patted Cathys shoulder and she smiled up at him
Dr Tilson closed the door behind him and came back to the bed His face was red with anger
Why did you do it
Cathys mouth was a thin tight line
Does your husband know you are pregnant
Her head moved slowly from side to side
What did you do it with
She stared up at him
He looked around the room He stepped to the bureau and picked up a knitting needle He shook
it in her face The old offenderthe old criminal he said Youre a fool Youve nearly killed
yourself and you havent lost your baby I suppose you took things too poisoned yourself
inserted camphor kerosene red pepper My God Some of the things you women do
Her eyes were as cold as glass
He pulled a chair up beside her bed Why dont you want to have the baby he asked softly
Youve got a good husband Dont you love him Dont you intend to speak to me at all Tell
me damn it Dont turn mulish
Her lips did not move and her eyes did not flicker
My dear he said cant you see You must not destroy life Thats the one thing gets me crazy
God knows I lose patients because I dont know enough But I tryI always try And then I see a
deliberate killing He talked rapidly on He dreaded the sick silence between his sentences This
woman puzzled him There was something inhuman about her Have you met Mrs Laurel
Shes wasting and crying for a baby Everything she has or can get she would give to have a
baby and youyou try to stab yours with a knitting needle All right he cried you wont speak
you dont have to But Im going to tell you The baby is safe Your aim was bad And Im
telling you thisyoure going to have that baby Do you know what the law in this state has to
say about abortion You dont have to answer but you listen to me If this happens again if you
lose this baby and I have any reason to suspect monkey business I will charge you I will testify
against you and I will see you punished Now I hope you have sense enough to believe me
because I mean it
Cathy moistened her lips with a little pointed tongue The cold went out of her eyes and a weak
sadness took its place Im sorry she said Im sorry But you dont understand
Then why dont you tell me His anger disappeared like mist Tell me my dear
Its hard to tell Adam is so good so strong I amwell Im tainted Epilepsy
Not you
No but my grandfather and my fatherand my brother She covered her eyes with her hands
I couldnt bring that to my husband
Poor child he said My poor child You cant be certain Its more than probable that your
baby will be fine and healthy Will you promise me not to try any more tricks
All right then I wont tell your husband what you did Now lie back and let me see if the
bleedings stopped
In a few minutes he closed his satchel and put the knitting needle in his pocket Ill look in
tomorrow morning he said
Adam swarmed on him as he came down the narrow stairs into the lobby Dr Tilson warded off a
flurry of How is she Is she all right What caused it Can I go up
Whoa hold uphold up And he used his trick his standard joke Your wife is sick
Doctor
She has the only good sickness there is
Your wife is going to have a baby He brushed past Adam and left him staring Three men
sitting around the stove grinned at him One of them observed dryly If it was me nowwhy
Id invite a few maybe three friends to have a drink His hint was wasted Adam bolted
clumsily up the narrow stairs
Adams attention narrowed to the Bordoni ranch a few miles south of King City almost
euidistant in fact between San Lucas and King City
The Bordonis had nine hundred acres left of a grant of ten thousand acres which had come to
Mrs Bordonis greatgrandfather from the Spanish crown The Bordonis were Swiss but Mrs
Bordoni was the daughter and heiress of a Spanish family that had settled in the Salinas Valley
in very early times And as happened with most of the old families the land slipped away Some
was lost in gambling some chipped off for taxes and some acres torn off like coupons to buy
luxuriesa horse a diamond or a pretty woman The nine hundred remaining acres were the
core of the original Sanchez grant and the best of it too They straddled the river and tucked into
the foothills on both sides for at this point the valley narrows and then opens out again The
original Sanchez house was still usable Built of adobe it stood in a tiny opening in the foothills
a miniature valley fed by a precious everrunning spring of sweet water That of course was why
the first Sanchez had built his seat there Huge live oaks shaded the valley and the earth had a
richness and a greenness foreign to this part of the country The walls of the low house were four
feet thick and the round pole rafters were tied on with rawhide ropes which had been put on wet
The hide shrank and pulled joist and rafter tight together and the leather ropes became hard as
iron and nearly imperishable There is only one drawback to this building method Rats will gnaw
at the hide if they are let
The old house seemed to have grown out of the earth and it was lovely Bordoni used it for a cow
barn He was a Swiss an immigrant with his national passion for cleanliness He distrusted the
thick mud walls and built a frame house some distance away and his cows put their heads out the
deep recessed windows of the old Sanchez house
The Bordonis were childless and when the wife died in ripe years a lonely longing for his Alpine
past fell on her husband He wanted to sell the ranch and go home Adam Trask refused to buy in
a hurry and Bordoni was asking a big price and using the selling method of pretending not to
care whether he sold or not Bordoni knew Adam was going to buy his land long before Adam
knew it
Where Adam settled he intended to stay and to have his unborn children stay He was afraid he
might buy one place and then see another he liked better and all the time the Sanchez place was
drawing him With the advent of Cathy his life extended long and pleasantly ahead of him But
he went through all the motions of carefulness He drove and rode and walked over every foot of
the land He put a posthole auger down through the subsoil to test and feel and smell the under
earth He inuired about the small wild plants of field and riverside and hill In damp places he
knelt down and examined the game tracks in the mud mountain lion and deer coyote and wild
cat skunk and raccoon weasel and rabbit all overlaid with the pattern of uail tracks He
threaded among willows and sycamores and wild blackberry vines in the riverbed patted the
trunks of live oak and scrub oak madrone laurel toyon
Bordoni watched him with suinting eyes and poured tumblers of red wine sueezed from the
grapes of his small hillside vineyard It was Bordonis pleasure to get a little drunk every
afternoon And Adam who had never tasted wine began to like it
Over and over he asked Cathys opinion of the place Did she like it Would she be happy there
And he didnt listen to her noncommittal answers He thought that she linked arms with his
enthusiasm In the lobby of the King City hotel he talked to the men who gathered around the
stove and read the papers sent down from San Francisco
Its water I think about he said one evening I wonder how deep youd have to go to bring in a
well
A rancher crossed his denim knees You ought to go see Sam Hamilton he said He knows
more about water than anybody around here Hes a water witch and a welldigger too Hell tell
you Hes put down half the wells in this part of the valley
His companion chuckled Sams got a real legitimate reason to be interested in water Hasnt got
a goddam drop of it on his own place
How do I find him Adam asked
Ill tell you what Im going out to have him make some angle irons Ill take you with me if you
want Youll like Mr Hamilton Hes a fine man
Kind of a comical genius his companion said
They went to the Hamilton ranch in Louis Lippos buckboardLouis and Adam Trask The iron
straps rattled around in the box and a leg of venison wrapped in wet burlap to keep it cool
jumped around on top of the iron It was customary in that day to take some substantial lump of
food as a present when you went calling on a man for you had to stay to dinner unless you
wished to insult his house But a few guests could set back the feeding plans for the week if you
did not build up what you destroyed A uarter of pork or a rump of beef would do Louis had cut
down the venison and Adam provided a bottle of whisky
Now Ill have to tell you Louis said Mr Hamilton will like that but Mrs Hamilton has got a
skunner on it If I was you Id leave it under the seat and when we drive around to the shop why
then you can get it out Thats what we always do
Doesnt she let her husband take a drink
No bigger than a bird said Louis But shes got brassbound opinions Just you leave the bottle
under the seat
They left the valley road and drove into the worn and rutted hills over a set of wheel tracks
gulleyed by the winter rains The horses strained into their collars and the buckboard rocked and
swayed The year had not been kind to the hills and already in June they were dry and the stones
showed through the short burned feed The wild oats had headed out barely six inches above the
ground as though with knowledge that if they didnt make seed uickly they wouldnt get to seed
at all
Its not likely looking country Adam said
Likely Why Mr Trask its country that will break a mans heart and eat him up Likely Mr
Hamilton has a sizable piece and hed of starved to death on it with all those children The ranch
dont feed them He does all kinds of jobs and his boys are starting to bring in something now
Its a fine family
Adam stared at a line of dark mesuite that peeked out of a draw Why in the world would he
settle on a place like this
Louis Lippo as does every man loved to interpret to a stranger particularly if no native was
present to put up an argument Ill tell you he said Take memy father was Italian Came
here after the trouble but he brought a little money My place isnt very big but its nice My
father bought it He picked it out And take youI dont know how youre fixed and wouldnt
ask but they say youre trying to buy the old Sanchez place and Bordoni never gave anything
away Youre pretty well fixed or you couldnt even ask about it
Im comfortably off said Adam modestly
Im talking the long way around said Louis When Mr and Mrs Hamilton came into the
valley they didnt have a pot to piss in They had to take what was leftgovernment land that
nobody else wanted Twentyfive acres of it wont keep a cow alive even in good years and they
say the coyotes move away in bad years Theres people say they dont know how the Hamiltons
lived But of course Mr Hamilton went right to workthats how they lived Worked as a hired
hand till he got his threshing machine built
Must have made a go of it I hear of him all over
He made a go of it all right Raised nine children Ill bet he hasnt got four bits laid away How
could he
One side of the buckboard leaped up rolled over a big round stone and dropped down again The
horses were dark with sweat and lathered under the collar and britching
Ill be glad to talk to him said Adam
Well sir he raised one fine crophe had good children and he raised them fine All doing well
maybe except Joe Joehes the youngesttheyre talking about sending him to college but
all the rest are doing fine Mr Hamilton can be proud The house is just on the other side of the
next rise Dont forget and bring out that whiskyshell freeze you to the ground
The dry earth was ticking under the sun and the crickets rasped Its real godforsaken country
said Louis
Makes me feel mean said Adam
Hows that
Well Im fixed so I dont have to live on a place like this
Me too and I dont feel mean Im just goddam glad
When the buckboard topped the rise Adam could look down on the little cluster of buildings
which composed the Hamilton seata house with many leantos a cow shed a shop and a
wagon shed It was a dry and suneaten sightno big trees and a small handwatered garden
Louis turned to Adam and there was just a hint of hostility in his tone I want to put you straight
on one or two things Mr Trask Theres people that when they see Samuel Hamilton the first
time might get the idea hes full of bull He dont talk like other people Hes an Irishman And
hes all full of plansa hundred plans a day And hes all full of hope My Christ hed have to
be to live on this land But you remember thishes a fine worker a good blacksmith and some
of his plans work out And Ive heard him talk about things that were going to happen and they
did
Adam was alarmed at the hint of threat Im not a man to run another man down he said and
he felt that suddenly Louis thought of him as a stranger and an enemy
I just wanted you to get it straight Theres some people come in from the East and they think if
a man hasnt got a lot of money hes no good
I wouldnt think of
Mr Hamilton maybe hasnt got four bits put away but hes our people and hes as good as we
got And hes raised the nicest family youre likely to see I just want you to remember that
Adam was on the point of defending himself and then he said Ill remember Thanks for telling
Louis faced around front again There he issee out by the shop He must of heard us
Has he got a beard Adam asked peering
Yes got a nice beard Its turning white fast beginning to grizzle up
They drove past the frame house and saw Mrs Hamilton looking out the window at them and
they drew up in front of the shop where Samuel stood waiting for them
Adam saw a big man bearded like a patriarch his graying hair stirring in the air like thistledown
His cheeks above his beard were pink where the sun had burned his Irish skin He wore a clean
blue shirt overalls and a leather apron His sleeves were rolled up and his muscular arms were
clean too Only his hands were blackened from the forge After a uick glance Adam came back
to the eyes light blue and filled with a young delight The wrinkles around them were drawn in
radial lines inward by laughter
Louis he said Im glad to see you Even in the sweetness of our little heaven here we like to
see our friends He smiled at Adam and Louis said I brought Mr Adam Trask to see you Hes
a stranger from down east come to settle
Im glad said Samuel Well shake another time I wouldnt soil your hand with these forge
hooks
I brought some strap iron Mr Hamilton Would you make some angles for me The whole
frame of my header bed is fallen to hell
Sure I will Louis Get down get down Well put the horses to the shade
Theres a piece of venison behind and Mr Trask brought a little something
Samuel glanced toward the house Maybe well get out the little something when weve got the
rig behind the shed
Adam could hear the singing lilt of his speech and yet could detect no word pronounced in a
strange manner except perhaps in sharpened is and ls held high on the tongue
Louis will you outspan your team Ill take the vension in Liza will be glad She likes a
venison stew
Any of the young ones home
Well no they arent George and Will came home for the weekend and they all went last night
to a dance up Wild Horse Canyon at the Peach Tree schoolhouse Theyll come trooping back by
dusk We lack a sofa because of that Ill tell you laterLiza will have a vengeance on themit
was Tom did it Ill tell you later He laughed and started toward the house carrying the
wrapped deers haunch If you want you can bring the little something into the shop so you
dont let the sun glint on it
They heard him calling as he came near the house Liza youll never guess Louis Lippo has
brought a piece of venison bigger than you
Louis drove in back of the shed and Adam helped him take the horses out tie up the tugs and
halter them in the shade He meant that about the sun shining on the bottle said Louis
She must be a holy terror
No bigger than a bird but shes brassbound
Outspan  Adam said I think Ive heard it said that way or read it
Samuel rejoined them in the shop Liza will be happy if you will stay to dinner he said
She didnt expect us Adam protested
Hush man Shell make some extra dumplings for the stew Its a pleasure to have you here
Give me your straps Louis and lets see how you want them
He built a chip fire in the black suare of the forge and pulled a bellows breeze on it and then fed
wet coke over with his fingers until it glowed Here Louis he said wave your wing on my
fire Slow man slow and even He laid the strips of iron on the glowing coke No sir Mr
Trask Lizas used to cooking for nine starving children Nothing can startle her He tongued the
iron to more advantageous heat and he laughed Ill take that last back as a holy lie he said
My wife is rumbling like round stones in the surf And Ill caution the both of you not to
mention the word sofa Its a word of anger and sorrow to Liza
You said something about it Adam said
If you knew my boy Tom youd understand it better Mr Trask Louis knows him
Sure I know him Louis said
Samuel went on My Tom is a hellbent boy Always takes more on his plate than he can eat
Always plants more than he can harvest Pleasures too much sorrows too much Some people are
like that Liza thinks Im like that I dont know what will come to Tom Maybe greatness maybe
the noosewell Hamiltons have been hanged before And Ill tell you about that sometime
The sofa Adam suggested politely
Youre right I do and Liza says I do shepherd my words like rebellious sheep Well came the
dance at the Peach Tree school and the boys George Tom Will and Joe all decided to go And
of course the girls were asked George and Will and Joe poor simple boys each asked one lady
friend but Tomhe took too big a helping as usual He asked two Williams sisters Jennie and
Belle How many screw holes do you want Louis
Five said Louis
All right Now I must tell you Mr Trask that my Tom has all the egotism and selflove of a
boy who thinks hes ugly Mostly lets himself go fallow but comes a celebration and he garlands
himself like a maypole and he glories like spring flowers This takes him uite a piece of time
You notice the wagon house was empty George and Will and Joe started early and not so
beautiful as Tom George took the rig Will had the buggy and Joe got the little twowheeled
cart Samuels blue eyes shone with pleasure Well then Tom came out as shy and shining as a
Roman emperor and the only thing left with wheels was a hay rake and you cant take even one
Williams sister on that For good or bad Liza was taking her nap Tom sat on the steps and
thought it out Then I saw him go to the shed and hitch up two horses and take the doubletree off
the hay rake He wrestled the sofa out of the house and ran a fifthchain under the legsthe fine
gooseneck horsehair sofa that Liza loves better than anything I gave it to her to rest on before
George was born The last I saw Tom went dragging up the hill reclining at his ease on the sofa
to get the Williams girls And oh Lord itll be worn thin as a wafer from scraping by the time he
gets it back Samuel put down his tongs and placed his hands on his hips the better to laugh
And Liza has the smoke of brimstone coming out her nostrils Poor Tom
Adam said smiling Would you like to take a little something
That I would said Samuel He accepted the bottle and took a uick swallow of whisky and
passed it back
Uisuebaughits an Irish wordwhisky water of lifeand so it is
He took the red straps to his anvil and punched screw holes in them and bent the angles with his
hammer and the forked sparks leaped out Then he dipped the iron hissing into his halfbarrel of
black water There you are he said and threw them on the ground
I thank you said Louis How much will that be
The pleasure of your company
Its always like that Louis said helplessly
No when I put your new well down you paid my price
That reminds meMr Trask here is thinking of buying the Bordoni placethe old Sanchez
grantyou remember
I know it well said Samuel Its a fine piece
He was asking about water and I told him you knew more about that than anybody around here
Adam passed the bottle and Samuel took a delicate sip and wiped his mouth on his forearm
above the soot
I havent made up my mind said Adam Im just asking some uestions
Oh Lord man now youve put your foot in it They say its a dangerous thing to uestion an
Irishman because hell tell you I hope you know what youre doing when you issue me a license
to talk Ive heard two ways of looking at it One says the silent man is the wise man and the
other that a man without words is a man without thought Naturally I favor the secondLiza says
to a fault What do you want to know
Well take the Bordoni place How deep would you have to go to get water
Id have to see the spotsome places thirty feet some places a hundred and fifty and in some
places clear to the center of the world
But you could develop water
Nearly every place except my own
Ive heard you have a lack here
Heard Why God in heaven must have heard Ive screamed it loud enough
Theres a fourhundredacre piece beside the river Would there be water under it
Id have to look It seems to me its an odd valley If youll hold your patience close maybe I
can tell you a little bit about it for Ive looked at it and poked my stinger down into it A hungry
man gorges with his mindhe does indeed
Louis Lippo said Mr Trask is from New England He plans to settle here Hes been west
before thoughin the army fighting Indians
Were you now Then its you should talk and let me learn
I dont want to talk about it
Why not God help my family and my neighbors if I had fought the Indians
I didnt want to fight them sir The sir crept in without his knowing it
Yes I can understand that It must be a hard thing to kill a man you dont know and dont hate
Maybe that makes it easier said Louis
You have a point Louis But some men are friends with the whole world in their hearts and
there are others that hate themselves and spread their hatred around like butter on hot bread
Id rather you told me about this land Adam said uneasily for a sick picture of piledup bodies
came into his mind
What time is it
Louis stepped out and looked at the sun Not past ten oclock
If I get started I have no selfcontrol My son Will says I talk to trees when I cant find a human
vegetable He sighed and sat down on a nail keg I said it was a strange valley but maybe
thats because I was born in a green place Do you find it strange Louis
No I never been out of it
Ive dug into it plenty Samuel said Something went on under itmaybe still is going on
Theres an ocean bed underneath and below that another world But that neednt bother a
farming man Now on top is good soil particularly on the flats In the upper valley it is light and
sandy but mixed in with that the top sweetness of the hills that washed down on it in the winters
As you go north the valley widens out and the soil gets blacker and heavier and perhaps richer
Its my belief that marshes were there once and the roots of centuries rotted into the soil and
made it black and fertilized it And when you turn it up a little greasy clay mixes and holds it
together Thats from about Gonzales north to the river mouth Off to the sides around Salinas
and Blanco and Castroville and Moss Landing the marshes are still there And when one day
those marshes are drained off that will be the richest of all land in this red world
He always tells what it will be like someday Louis threw in
Well a mans mind cant stay in time the way his body does
If Im going to settle here I need to know about how and what will be said Adam My
children when I have them will be on it
Samuels eyes looked over the heads of his friends out of the dark forge to the yellow sunlight
Youll have to know that under a good part of the valley some places deep and others pretty
near the surface theres a layer called hardpan Its a clay hardpacked and it feels greasy too
Some places it is only a foot thick and more in others And this hardpan resists water If it were
not there the winter rains would go soaking down and dampen the earth and in the summer it
would rise up to the roots again But when the earth above the hardpan is soaked full the rest
runs fresheting off or stands rotting on top And thats one of the main curses of our valley
Well its a pretty good place to live isnt it
Yes it is but a man cant entirely rest when he knows it could be richer Ive thought that if you
could drive thousands of holes through it to let the water in it might solve it And then I tried
something with a few sticks of dynamite I punched a hole through the hardpan and blasted That
broke it up and the water could get down But God in heaven think of the amount of dynamite
Ive read that a Swedethe same man who invented dynamitehas got a new explosive stronger
and safer Maybe that might be the answer
Louis said half derisively and half with admiration Hes always thinking about how to change
things Hes never satisfied with the way they are
Samuel smiled at him They say men lived in trees one time Somebody had to get dissatisfied
with a high limb or your feet would not be touching flat ground now And then he laughed
again I can see myself sitting on my dust heap making a world in my mind as surely as God
created this one But God saw this world Ill never see mine exceptthis way This will be a
valley of great richness one day It could feed the world and maybe it will And happy people
will live here thousands and thousands A cloud seemed to come over his eyes and his face set
in sadness and he was silent
You make it sound like a good place to settle Adam said Where else could I raise my
children with that coming
Samuel went on Theres one thing I dont understand Theres a blackness on this valley I
dont know what it is but I can feel it Sometimes on a white blinding day I can feel it cutting off
the sun and sueezing the light out of it like a sponge His voice rose Theres a black violence
on this valley I dont knowI dont know Its as though some old ghost haunted it out of the
dead ocean below and troubled the air with unhappiness Its as secret as hidden sorrow I dont
know what it is but I see it and feel it in the people here
Adam shivered I just remembered I promised to get back early Cathy my wife is going to
have a baby
But Lizas getting ready
Shell understand when you tell her about the baby My wife is feeling poorly And I thank you
for telling me about the water
Have I depressed you with my rambling
No not at allnot at all Its Cathys first baby and shes miserable
Adam struggled all night with his thoughts and the next day he drove out and shook hands with
Bordoni and the Sanchez place was his
There is so much to tell about the Western country in that day that it is hard to know where to
start One thing sets off a hundred others The problem is to decide which one to tell first
You remember that Samuel Hamilton said his children had gone to a dance at the Peach Tree
School The country schools were the centers of culture then The Protestant churches in the
towns were fighting for their existence in a country where they were newcomers The Catholic
church first on the scene and deeply dug in sat in comfortable tradition while the missions were
gradually abandoned and their roofs fell in and pigeons roosted on the stripped altars The library
in Latin and Spanish of the San Antonio Mission was thrown into a granary where the rats ate
off the sheepskin bindings In the country the repository of art and science was the school and
the schoolteacher shielded and carried the torch of learning and of beauty The schoolhouse was
the meeting place for music for debate The polls were set in the schoolhouse for elections
Social life whether it was the crowning of a May ueen the eulogy to a dead president or an all
night dance could be held nowhere else And the teacher was not only an intellectual paragon
and a social leader but also the matrimonial catch of the countryside A family could indeed walk
proudly if a son married the schoolteacher Her children were presumed to have intellectual
advantages both inherited and conditioned
The daughters of Samuel Hamilton were not destined to become workdestroyed farm wives
They were handsome girls and they carried with them the glow of their descent from the kings of
Ireland They had a pride that transcended their poverty No one ever thought of them as
deserving pity Samuel raised a distinctly superior breed They were better read and better bred
than most of their contemporaries To all of them Samuel communicated his love of learning and
he set them apart from the prideful ignorance of their time Olive Hamilton became a teacher
That meant that she left home at fifteen and went to live in Salinas where she could go to
secondary school At seventeen she took county board examinations which covered all the arts
and sciences and at eighteen she was teaching school at Peach Tree
In her school there were pupils older and bigger than she was It reuired great tact to be a
schoolteacher To keep order among the big undisciplined boys without pistol and bull whip was
a difficult and dangerous business In one school in the mountains a teacher was raped by her
pupils
Olive Hamilton had not only to teach everything but to all ages Very few youths went past the
eighth grade in those days and what with farm duties some of them took fourteen or fifteen years
to do it Olive also had to practice rudimentary medicine for there were constant accidents She
sewed up knife cuts after a fight in the schoolyard When a small barefooted boy was bitten by a
rattlesnake it was her duty to suck his toe to draw the poison out
She taught reading to the first grade and algebra to the eighth She led the singing acted as a
critic of literature wrote the social notes that went weekly to the Salinas Journal In addition the
whole social life of the area was in her hands not only graduation exercises but dances
meetings debates chorals Christmas and May Day festivals patriotic exudations on Decoration
Day and the Fourth of July She was on the election board and headed and held together all
charities It was far from an easy job and it had duties and obligations beyond belief The teacher
had no private life She was watched jealously for any weakness of character She could not
board with one family for more than one term for that would cause jealousya family gained
social ascendancy by boarding the teacher If a marriageable son belonged to the family where
she boarded a proposal was automatic if there was more than one claimant vicious fights
occurred over her hand The Aguita boys three of them nearly clawed each other to death over
Olive Hamilton Teachers rarely lasted very long in the country schools The work was so hard
and the proposals so constant that they married within a very short time
This was a course Olive Hamilton determined she would not take She did not share the
intellectual enthusiasms of her father but the time she had spent in Salinas determined her not to
be a ranch wife She wanted to live in a town perhaps not so big as Salinas but at least not a
crossroads In Salinas Olive had experienced niceties of living the choir and vestments Altar
Guild and bean suppers of the Episcopal church She had partaken of the artsroad companies
of plays and even operas with their magic and promise of an aromatic world outside She had
gone to parties played charades competed in poetry readings joined a chorus and orchestra
Salinas had tempted her There she could go to a party dressed for the party and come home in
the same dress instead of rolling her clothes in a saddlebag and riding ten miles then unrolling
and pressing them
Busy though she was with her teaching Olive longed for the metropolitan life and when the
young man who had built the flour mill in King City sued properly for her hand she accepted
him subject to a long and secret engagement The secrecy was reuired because if it were known
there would be trouble among the young men in the neighborhood
Olive had not her fathers brilliance but she did have a sense of fun together with her mothers
strong and undeviating will What light and beauty could be forced down the throats of her
reluctant pupils she forced
There was a wall against learning A man wanted his children to read to figure and that was
enough More might make them dissatisfied and flighty And there were plenty of examples to
prove that learning made a boy leave the farm to live in the cityto consider himself better than
his father Enough arithmetic to measure land and lumber and to keep accounts enough writing
to order goods and write to relatives enough reading for newspapers almanacs and farm
journals enough music for religious and patriotic displaythat was enough to help a boy and not
to lead him astray Learning was for doctors lawyers and teachers a class set off and not
considered related to other people There were some sports of course like Samuel Hamilton and
he was tolerated and liked but if he had not been able to dig a well shoe a horse or run a
threshing machine God knows what would have been thought of the family
Olive did marry her young man and did move first to Paso Robles then to King City and finally
to Salinas She was as intuitive as a cat Her acts were based on feelings rather than thoughts She
had her mothers firm chin and button nose and her fathers fine eyes She was the most definite
of any of the Hamiltons except her mother Her theology was a curious mixture of Irish fairies
and an Old Testament Jehovah whom in her later life she confused with her father Heaven was to
her a nice home ranch inhabited by her dead relatives External realities of a frustrating nature
she obliterated by refusing tobelieve in them and when one resisted her disbelief she raged at it
It was told of her that she cried bitterly because she could not go to two dances on one Saturday
night One was in Greenfield and the other in San Lucastwenty miles apart To have gone to
both and then home would have entailed a sixtymile horseback ride This was a fact she could
not blast with her disbelief and so she cried with vexation and went to neither dance
As she grew older she developed a scattergun method for dealing with unpleasant facts When I
her only son was sixteen I contracted pleural pneumonia in that day a killing disease I went
down and down until the wing tips of the angels brushed my eyes Olive used her scattergun
method of treating pleural pneumonia and it worked The Episcopalian minister prayed with and
for me the Mother Superior and nuns of the convent next to our house held me up to Heaven for
relief twice a day a distant relative who was a Christian Science reader held the thought for me
Every incantation magic and herbal formula known was brought out and she got two good
nurses and the towns best doctors Her method was practical I got well She was loving and firm
with her family three girls and me trained us in housework dish washing clothes washing and
manners When angered she had a terrible eye which could blanch the skin off a bad child as
easily as if he were a boiled almond
When I recovered from my pneumonia it came time for me to learn to walk again I had been nine
weeks in bed and the muscles had gone lax and the laziness of recovery had set in When I was
helped up every nerve cried and the wound in my side which had been opened to drain the pus
from the pleural cavity pained horribly I fell back in bed crying I cant do it I cant get up
Olive fixed me with her terrible eye Get up she said Your father has worked all day and sat
up all night He has gone into debt for you Now get up
And I got up
Debt was an ugly word and an ugly concept to Olive A bill unpaid past the fifteenth of the month
was a debt The word had connotations of dirt and slovenliness and dishonor Olive who truly
believed that her family was the best in the world uite snobbishly would not permit it to be
touched by debt She planted that terror of debt so deeply in her children that even now in a
changed economic pattern where indebtedness is a part of living I become restless when a bill is
two days overdue Olive never accepted the timepayment plan when it became popular A thing
bought on time was a thing you did not own and for which you were in debt She saved for things
she wanted and this meant that the neighbors had new gadgets as much as two years before we
Olive had great courage Perhaps it takes courage to raise children And I must tell you what she
did about the First World War Her thinking was not international Her first boundary was the
geography of her family second her town Salinas and finally there was a dotted line not clearly
defined which was the county line Thus she did not uite believe in the war not even when
Troop C our militia cavalry was called out loaded its horses on a train and set out for the open
world
Martin Hopps lived around the corner from us He was wide short redhaired His mouth was
wide and he had red eyes He was almost the shyest boy in Salinas To say good morning to him
was to make him itch with selfconsciousness He belonged to Troop C because the armory had a
basketball court
If the Germans had known Olive and had been sensible they would have gone out of their way
not to anger her But they didnt know or they were stupid When they killed Martin Hopps they
lost the war because that made my mother mad and she took out after them She had liked
Martin Hopps He had never hurt anyone When they killed him Olive declared war on the
German empire
She cast about for a weapon Knitting helmets and socks was not deadly enough for her For a
time she put on a Red Cross uniform and met other ladies similarly dressed in the armory where
bandages were rolled and reputations unrolled This was all right but it was not driving at the
heart of the Kaiser Olive wanted blood for the life of Martin Hopps She found her weapon in
Liberty bonds She had never sold anything in her life beyond an occasional angel cake for the
Altar Guild in the basement of the Episcopal church but she began to sell bonds by the bale She
brought ferocity to her work I think she made people afraid not to buy them And when they did
buy from Olive she gave them a sense of actual combat of putting a bayonet in the stomach of
Germany
As her sales skyrocketed and stayed up the Treasury Department began to notice this new
Amazon First there came mimeographed letters of commendation then real letters signed by the
Secretary of the Treasury and not with a rubber stamp either We were proud but not so proud as
when prizes began to arrive a German helmet too small for any of us to wear a bayonet a
jagged piece of shrapnel set on an ebony base Since we were not eligible for armed conflict
beyond marching with wooden guns our mothers war seemed to justify us And then she outdid
herself and outdid everyone in our part of the country She uadrupled her already fabulous
record and she was awarded the fairest prize of alla ride in an army airplane
Oh we were proud kids Even vicariously this was an eminence we could hardly stand But my
poor motherI must tell you that there are certain things in the existence of which my mother
did not believe against any possible evidence to the contrary One was a bad Hamilton and
another was the airplane The fact that she had seen them didnt make her believe in them one bit
more
In the light of what she did I have tried to imagine how she felt Her soul must have crawled with
horror for how can you fly in something that does not exist As a punishment the ride would
have been cruel and unusual but it was a prize a gift an honor and an eminence She must have
looked into our eyes and seen the shining idolatry there and understood that she was trapped Not
to have gone would have let her family down She was surrounded and there was no honorable
way out save death Once she had decided to go up in the nonexistent thing she seemed to have
had no idea whatever that she would survive it
Olive made her willtook lots of time with it and had it checked to be sure it was legal Then she
opened her rosewood box wherein were the letters her husband had written to her in courtship
and since We had not known he wrote poetry to her but he had She built a fire in the grate and
burned every letter They were hers and she wanted no other human to see them She bought all
new underwear She had a horror of being found dead with mended or worse unmended under
clothes I think perhaps she saw the wide twisted mouth and embarrassed eyes of Martin Hopps
on her and felt that in some way she was reimbursing him for his stolen life She was very gentle
with us and did not notice a badly washed dinner plate that left a greasy stain on the dish towel
This glory was scheduled to take place at the Salinas Race Track and Rodeo Grounds We were
driven to the track in an army automobile feeling more solemn and golden than at a good funeral
Our father was working at the Spreckles Sugar Factory five miles from town and could not get
off or perhaps didnt want to for fear he could not stand the strain But Olive had made
arrangements on pain of not going up for the plane to try to fly as far as the sugar factory before
it crashed
I realize now that the several hundred people who had gathered simply came to see the airplane
but at that time we thought they were there to do my mother honor Olive was not a tall woman
and at that age she had begun to put on weight We had to help her out of the car She was
probably stiff with fright but her little chin was set
The plane stood in the field around which the race track was laid out It was appallingly little and
flimsyan open cockpit biplane with wooden struts tied with piano wire The wings were
covered with canvas Olive was stunned She went to the side as an ox to the knife Over the
clothes she was convinced were her burial clothes two sergeants slipped on a coat a padded coat
and a flight coat and she grew rounder and rounder with each layer Then a leather helmet and
goggles and with her little button of a nose and her pink cheeks you really had something She
looked like a goggled ball The two sergeants hoisted her bodily into the cockpit and wedged her
in She filled the opening completely As they strapped her in she suddenly came to life and
began waving frantically for attention One of the soldiers climbed up listened to her came over
to my sister Mary and led her to the side of the plane Olive was tugging at the thick padded
flight glove on her left hand She got her hands free took off her engagement ring with its tiny
diamond and handed it down to Mary She set her gold wedding ring firmly pulled the gloves
back on and faced the front The pilot climbed into the front cockpit and one of the sergeants
threw his weight on the wooden propeller The little ship taxied away and turned and down the
field it roared and staggered into the air and Olive was looking straight ahead and probably her
eyes were closed
We followed it with our eyes as it swept up and away leaving a lonesome silence behind it The
bond committee the friends and relatives the simple unhonored spectators didnt think of leaving
the field The plane became a speck in the sky toward Spreckles and disappeared It was fifteen
minutes before we saw it again flying serenely and very high Then to our horror it seemed to
stagger and fall It fell endlessly caught itself climbed and made a loop One of the sergeants
laughed For a moment the plane steadied and then it seemed to go crazy It barrelrolled made
Immelmann turns inside and outside loops and turned over and flew over the field upside down
We could see the black bullet which was our mothers helmet One of the soldiers said uietly I
think hes gone nuts Shes not a young woman
The airplane landed steadily enough and ran up to the group The motor died The pilot climbed
out shaking his head in perplexity Goddamest woman I ever saw he said He reached up and
shook Olives nerveless hand and walked hurriedly away
It took four men and uite a long time to get Olive out of the cockpit She was so rigid they could
not bend her We took her home and put her to bed and she didnt get up for two days
What had happened came out slowly The pilot talked some and Olive talked some and both
stories had to be put together before they made sense They had flown out and circled the
Spreckles Sugar Factory as orderedcircled it three times so that our father would be sure to see
and then the pilot thought of a joke He meant no harm He shouted something and his face
looked contorted Olive could not hear over the noise of the engine The pilot throttled down and
shouted Stunt It was a kind of joke Olive saw his goggled face and the slip stream caught his
word and distorted it What Olive heard was the word stuck
Well she thought here it is just as I knew it would be Here was her death Her mind flashed to
see if she had forgotten anythingwill made letters burned new underwear plenty of food in
the house for dinner She wondered whether she had turned out the light in the back room It was
all in a second Then she thought there might be an outside chance of survival The young soldier
was obviously frightened and fear might be the worst thing that could happen to him in handling
the situation If she gave way to the panic that lay on her heart it might frighten him more She
decided to encourage him She smiled brightly and nodded to give him courage and then the
bottom fell out of the world When he leveled out of his loop the pilot looked back again and
shouted More
Olive was way beyond hearing anything but her chin was set and she was determined to help the
pilot so that he would not be too afraid before they hit the earth She smiled and nodded again At
the end of each stunt he looked back and each time she encouraged him Afterward he said over
and over Shes the goddamest woman I ever saw I tore up the rule book and she wanted more
Good Christ what a pilot she would have made
Adam sat like a contented cat on his land From the entrance to the little draw under a giant oak
which dipped its roots into underground water he could look out over the acres lying away to the
river and across to an alluvial flat and then up the rounded foothills on the western side It was a
fair place even in the summer when the sun laced into it A line of river willows and sycamores
banded it in the middle and the western hills were yellowbrown with feed For some reason the
mountains to the west of the Salinas Valley have a thicker skin of earth on them than have the
eastern foothills so that the grass is richer there Perhaps the peaks store rain and distribute it
more evenly and perhaps being more wooded they draw more rainfall
Very little of the Sanchez now Trask place was under cultivation but Adam in his mind could
see the wheat growing tall and suares of green alfalfa near the river Behind him he could hear
the rackety hammering of the carpenters brought all the way from Salinas to rebuild the old
Sanchez house Adams had decided to live in the old house Here was a place in which to plant
his dynasty The manure was scraped out the old floors torn up neckrubbed window casings
ripped away New sweet wood was going in pine sharp with resin and velvety redwood and a
new roof of long split shakes The old thick walls sucked in coat after coat of whitewash made
with lime and salt water which as it dried seemed to have a luminosity of its own
He planned a permanent seat A gardener had trimmed the ancient roses planted geraniums laid
out the vegetable flat and brought the living spring in little channels to wander back and forth
through the garden Adam foretasted comfort for himself and his descendants In a shed covered
with tarpaulins lay the crated heavy furniture sent from San Francisco and carted out from King
City
He would have good living too Lee his pigtailed Chinese cook had made a special trip to Pajaro
to buy the pots and kettles and pans kegs jars copper and glass for his kitchen A new pigsty
was building far from the house and downwind with chicken and duck runs near and a kennel for
the dogs to keep the coyotes away It was no uick thing Adam contemplated to be finished and
ready in a hurry His men worked deliberately and slowly It was a long job Adam wanted it
well done He inspected every wooden joint stood off to study paint samples on a shingle In the
corner of his room catalogues piled upcatalogues for machinery furnishing seeds fruit trees
He was glad now that his father had left him a rich man In his mind a darkness was settling over
his memory of Connecticut Perhaps the hard flat light of the West was blotting out his
birthplace When he thought back to his fathers house to the farm the town to his brothers
face there was a blackness over all of it And he shook off the memories
Temporarily he had moved Cathy into the whitepainted clean spare house of Bordoni there to
await the home and the child There was no doubt whatever that the child would be finished well
before the house was ready But Adam was unhurried
I want it built strong he directed over and over I want it to lastcopper nails and hard wood
nothing to rust and rot
He was not alone in his preoccupation with the future The whole valley the whole West was that
way It was a time when the past had lost its sweetness and its sap Youd go a good long road
before youd find a man and he very old who wished to bring back a golden past Men were
notched and comfortable in the present hard and unfruitful as it was but only as a doorstep into a
fantastic future Rarely did two men meet or three stand in a bar or a dozen gnaw tough venison
in camp that the valleys future paralyzing in its grandeur did not come up not as conjecture
but as a certainty
Itll bewho knows maybe in our lifetime they said
And people found happiness in the future according to their present lack Thus a man might bring
his family down from a hill ranch in a draga big box nailed on oaken runners which pulled
bumping down the broken hills In the straw of the box his wife would brace the children against
the toothshattering tonguebiting crash of the runners against stone and ground And the father
would set his heels and think When the roads come inthen will be the time Why well sit
high and happy in a surrey and get clear into King City in three hoursand what more in the
world could you want than that
Or let a man survey his grove of liveoak trees hard as coal and hotter the best firewood in the
world In his pocket might be a newspaper with a suib Oak cord wood is bringing ten dollars a
cord in Los Angeles Why hell when the railroad puts a branch out here I could lay it down
neat broke up and seasoned right beside the track for a dollar and a half a cord Lets go whole
hog and say the Southern Pacific will charge threefifty to carry it Theres still five dollars a
cord and theres three thousand cords in that little grove alone Thats fifteen thousand dollars
right there
There were others who prophesied with rays shining on their foreheads about the sometime
ditches that would carry water all over the valleywho knows maybe in our lifetimeor deep
wells with steam engines to pump the water up out of the guts of the world Can you imagine
Just think what this land would raise with plenty of water Why it will be a frigging garden
Another man but he was crazy said that someday thered be a way maybe ice maybe some
other way to get a peach like this here I got in my hand clear to Philadelphia
In the towns they talked of sewers and inside toilets and some already had them and arc lights
on the street cornersSalinas had thoseand telephones There wasnt any limit no boundary at
all to the future And it would be so a man wouldnt have room to store his happiness
Contentment would flood raging down the valley like the Salinas River in March of a thirtyinch
year
They looked over the flat dry dusty valley and the ugly mushroom towns and they saw a
lovelinesswho knows maybe in our lifetime Thats one reason you couldnt laugh too much
at Samuel Hamilton He let his mind range more deliciously than any other and it didnt sound so
silly when you heard what they were doing in San Jose Where Samuel went haywire was
wondering whether people would be happy when all that came
Happy Hes haywire now Just let us get it and well show you happiness
And Samuel could remember hearing of a cousin of his mothers in Ireland a knight and rich and
handsome and anyway shot himself on a silken couch sitting beside the most beautiful woman
in the world who loved him
Theres a capacity for appetite Samuel said that a whole heaven and earth of cake cant
satisfy
Adam Trask nosed some of his happiness into futures but there was present contentment in him
too He felt his heart smack up against his throat when he saw Cathy sitting in the sun uiet her
baby growing and a transparency to her skin that made him think of the angels on Sunday School
cards Then a breeze would move her bright hair or she would raise her eyes and Adam would
swell out in his stomach with a pressure of ecstasy that was close kin to grief
If Adam rested like a sleek fed cat on his land Cathy was catlike too She had the inhuman
attribute of abandoning what she could not get and of waiting for what she could get These two
gifts gave her great advantages Her pregnancy had been an accident When her attempt to abort
herself failed and the doctor threatened her she gave up that method This does not mean that she
reconciled herself to pregnancy She sat it out as she would have weathered an illness Her
marriage to Adam had been the same She was trapped and she took the best possible way out
She had not wanted to go to California either but other plans were denied her for the time being
As a very young child she had learned to win by using the momentum of her opponent It was
easy to guide a mans strength where it was impossible to resist him Very few people in the
world could have known that Cathy did not want to be where she was and in the condition she
was She relaxed and waited for the change she knew must come some time Cathy had the one
uality reuired of a great and successful criminal she trusted no one confided in no one Her
self was an island It is probable that she did not even look at Adams new land or building
house or turn his towering plans to reality in her mind because she did not intend to live here
after her sickness was over after her trap opened But to his uestions she gave proper answers
to do otherwise would be waste motion and dissipated energy and foreign to a good cat
See my darling how the house lieswindows looking down the valley
Its beautiful
You know it may sound foolish but I find myself trying to think the way old Sanchez did a
hundred years ago How was the valley then He must have planned so carefully You know he
had pipes He didmade out of redwood with a hole bored or burned through to carry the water
down from the spring We dug up some pieces of it
Thats remarkable she said He must have been clever
Id like to know more about him From the way the house sets the trees he left the shape and
proportion of the house he must have been a kind of an artist
He was a Spaniard wasnt he Theyre artistic people Ive heard I remember in school about a
painterno he was a Greek
I wonder where I could find out about old Sanchez
Well somebody must know
All of his work and planning and Bordoni kept cows in the house You know what I wonder
about most
What Adam
I wonder if he had a Cathy and who she was
She smiled and looked down and away from him The things you say
He must have had He must have had I never had energy or direction orwell even a very
great desire to live before I had you
Adam you embarrass me Adam be careful Dont joggle me it hurts
Im sorry Im so clumsy
No youre not You just dont think Should I be knitting or sewing do you suppose Im so
comfortable just sitting
Well buy everything we need You just sit and be comfortable I guess in a way youre working
harder than anyone here But the paythe pay is wonderful
Adam the scar on my forehead isnt going to go away Im afraid
The doctor said it would fade in time
Well sometimes it seems to be getting fainter and then it comes back Dont you think its
darker today
But it was It looked like a huge thumbprint even to whorls of wrinkled skin He put his finger
near and she drew her head away
Dont she said Its tender to the touch It turns red if you touch it
It will go away Just takes a little time thats all
She smiled as he turned but when he walked away her eyes were flat and directionless She
shifted her body restlessly The baby was kicking She relaxed and all her muscles loosened She
waited
Lee came near where her chair was set under the biggest oak tree Missy likee tea
Noyes I would too
Her eyes inspected him and her inspection could not penetrate the dark brown of his eyes He
made her uneasy Cathy had always been able to shovel into the mind of any man and dig up his
impulses and his desires But Lees brain gave and repelled like rubber His face was lean and
pleasant his forehead broad firm and sensitive and his lips curled in a perpetual smile His long
black glossy braided ueue tied at the bottom with a narrow piece of black silk hung over his
shoulder and moved rhythmically against his chest When he did violent work he curled his
ueue on top of his head He wore narrow cotton trousers black heelless slippers and a frogged
Chinese smock Whenever he could he hid his hands in his sleeves as though he were afraid for
them as most Chinese did in that day
I bling litta table he said bowed slightly and shuffled away
Cathy looked after him and her eyebrows drew down in a scowl She was not afraid of Lee yet
she was not comfortable with him either But he was a good and respectful servantthe best
And what harm could he do her
The summer progressed and the Salinas River retired underground or stood in green pools under
high banks The cattle lay drowsing all day long under the willows and only moved out at night to
feed An umber tone came to the grass And the afternoon winds blowing inevitably down the
valley started a dust that was like fog and raised it into the sky almost as high as the
mountaintops The wild oat roots stood up like niggerheads where the winds blew the earth
away Along a polished earth pieces of straw and twigs scampered until they were stopped by
some rooted thing and little stones rolled crookedly before the wind
It became more apparent than ever why old Sanchez had built his house in the little draw for the
wind and the dust did not penetrate and the spring while it diminished still gushed a head of
cold clear water But Adam looking out over his dry dustobscured land felt the panic the
Eastern man always does at first in California In a Connecticut summer two weeks without rain
is a dry spell and four a drought If the countryside is not green it is dying But in California it
does not ordinarily rain at all between the end of May and the first of November The Eastern
man though he has been told feels the earth is sick in the rainless months
Adam sent Lee with a note to the Hamilton place to ask Samuel to visit him and discuss the
boring of some wells on his new place
Samuel was sitting in the shade watching his son Tom design and build a revolutionary coon
trap when Lee drove up in the Trask cart Lee folded his hands in his sleeves and waited Samuel
read the note Tom he said do you think you could keep the estate going while I run down
and talk water with a dry man
Why dont I go with you You might need some help
At talkingthat I dont It wont come to digging for some time if Im any judge With wells
theres got to be a great deal of talkfive or six hundred words for every shovel of dirt
Id like to goits Mr Trask isnt it I didnt meet him when he came here
Youll do that when the digging starts Im older than you Ive got first claim on the talk You
know Tom a coon is going to reach his pretty little hand through here and let himself out You
know how clever they are
See this piece here It screws on and turns down here You couldnt get out of that yourself
Im not so clever as a coon I think youve worked it out though Tom boy would you saddle
Doxology while I go tell your mother where Im going
I bling lig said Lee
Well I have to come home some time
I bling back
Nonsense said Samuel Ill lead my horse in and ride back
Samuel sat in the buggy beside Lee and his clobberfooted saddle horse shuffled clumsily behind
Whats your name Samuel asked pleasantly
Lee Got more name Lee papa family name Call Lee
Ive read uite a lot about China You born in China
No Born here
Samuel was silent for uite a long time while the buggy lurched down the wheel track toward the
dusty valley Lee he said at last I mean no disrespect but Ive never been able to figure why
you people still talk pidgin when an illiterate baboon from the black bogs of Ireland with a head
full of Gaelic and a tongue like a potato learns to talk a poor grade of English in ten years
Lee grinned Me talkee Chinese talk he said
Well I guess you have your reasons And its not my affair I hope youll forgive me if I dont
believe it Lee
Lee looked at him and the brown eyes under their rounded upper lids seemed to open and deepen
until they werent foreign any more but mans eyes warm with understanding Lee chuckled
Its more than a convenience he said Its even more than selfprotection Mostly we have to
use it to be understood at all
Samuel showed no sign of having observed any change I can understand the first two he said
thoughtfully but the third escapes me
Lee said I know its hard to believe but it has happened so often to me and to my friends that
we take if for granted If I should go up to a lady or a gentleman for instance and speak as I am
doing now I wouldnt be understood
Pidgin they expect and pidgin theyll listen to But English from me they dont listen to and so
they dont understand it
Can that be possible How do I understand you
Thats why Im talking to you You are one of the rare people who can separate your
observation from your preconception You see what is where most people see what they expect
I hadnt thought of it And Ive not been so tested as you but what you say has a candle of truth
You know Im very glad to talk to you Ive wanted to ask so many uestions
Happy to oblige
So many uestions For instance you wear the ueue Ive read that it is a badge of slavery
imposed by conuest by the Manchus on the Southern Chinese
That is true
Then why in the name of God do you wear it here where the Manchus cant get at you
Talkee Chinese talk ueue Chinese fashionyou savvy
Samuel laughed loudly That does have the green touch of convenience he said I wish I had a
hideyhole like that
Im wondering whether I can explain said Lee Where there is no likeness of experience its
very difficult I understand you were not born in America
No in Ireland
And in a few years you can almost disappear while I who was born in Grass Valley went to
school and several years to the University of California have no chance of mixing
If you cut your ueue dressed and talked like other people
No I tried it To the socalled whites I was still a Chinese but an untrustworthy one and at the
same time my Chinese friends steered clear of me I had to give it up
Lee pulled up under a tree got out and unfastened the check rein Time for lunch he said I
made a package Would you like some
Sure I would Let me get down in the shade there I forget to eat sometimes and thats strange
because Im always hungry Im interested in what you say It has a sweet sound of authority
Now it peeks into my mind that you should go back to China
Lee smiled satirically at him In a few minutes I dont think youll find a loose bar Ive missed
in a lifetime of search I did go back to China My father was a fairly successful man It didnt
work They said I looked like a foreign devil they said I spoke like a foreign devil I made
mistakes in manners and I didnt know delicacies that had grown up since my father left They
wouldnt have me You can believe it or notIm less foreign here than I was in China
Ill have to believe you because its reasonable Youve given me things to think about until at
least February twentyseventh Do you mind my uestions
As a matter of fact no The trouble with pidgin is that you get to thinking in pidgin I write a
great deal to keep my English up Hearing and reading arent the same as speaking and writing
Dont you ever make a mistake I mean break into English
No I dont I think its a matter of what is expected You look at a mans eyes you see that he
expects pidgin and a shuffle so you speak pidgin and shuffle
I guess thats right said Samuel In my own way I tell jokes because people come all the way
to my place to laugh I try to be funny for them even when the sadness is on me
But the Irish are said to be a happy people full of jokes
Theres your pidgin and your ueue Theyre not Theyre a dark people with a gift for suffering
way past their deserving Its said that without whisky to soak and soften the world theyd kill
themselves But they tell jokes because its expected of them
Lee unwrapped a little bottle Would you like some of this Chinese drink ngkapy
Chinee blandy Stlong dlinkas a matter of fact its a brandy with a dosage of wormwood Very
powerful It softens the world
Samuel sipped from the bottle Tastes a little like rotten apples he said
Yes but nice rotten apples Taste it back along your tongue toward the roots
Samuel took a big swallow and tilted his head back I see what you mean That is good
Here are some sandwiches pickles cheese a can of buttermilk
You do well
Yes I see to it
Samuel bit into a sandwich I was shuffling over half a hundred uestions What you said brings
the brightest one up You dont mind
Not at all The only thing I do want to ask of you is not to talk this way when other people are
listening It would only confuse them and they wouldnt believe it anyway
Ill try said Samuel If I slip just remember that Im a comical genius Its hard to split a man
down the middle and always to reach for the same half
I think I can guess what your next uestion is
Why am I content to be a servant
How in the world did you know
It seemed to follow
Do you resent the uestion
Not from you There are no ugly uestions except those clothed in condescension I dont know
where being a servant came into disrepute It is the refuge of a philosopher the food of the lazy
and properly carried out it is a position of power even of love I cant understand why more
intelligent people dont take it as a careerlearn to do it well and reap its benefits A good
servant has absolute security not because of his masters kindness but because of habit and
indolence Its a hard thing for a man to change spices or lay out his own socks Hell keep a bad
servant rather than change But a good servant and I am an excellent one can completely control
his master tell him what to think how to act whom to marry when to divorce reduce him to
terror as a discipline or distribute happiness to him and finally be mentioned in his will If I had
wished I could have robbed stripped and beaten anyone Ive worked for and come away with
thanks Finally in my circumstances I am unprotected My master will defend me protect me
You have to work and worry I work less and worry less And I am a good servant A bad one
does no work and does no worrying and he still is fed clothed and protected I dont know any
profession where the field is so cluttered with incompetents and where excellence is so rare
Samuel leaned toward him listening intently
Lee went on Its going to be a relief after that to go back to pidgin
Its a very short distance to the Sanchez place Why did we stop so near Samuel asked
Allee time talkee Me Chinee number one boy You leddy go now
What Oh sure But it must be a lonely life
Thats the only fault with it said Lee Ive been thinking of going to San Francisco and
starting a little business
Like a laundry Or a grocery store
No Too many Chinese laundries and restaurants I thought perhaps a bookstore Id like that
and the competition wouldnt be too great I probably wont do it though A servant loses his
initiative
In the afternoon Samuel and Adam rode over the land The wind came up as it did every
afternoon and the yellow dust ran into the sky
Oh its a good piece Samuel cried Its a rare piece of land
Seems to me its blowing away bit by bit Adam observed
No its just moving over a little You lose some to the James ranch but you get some from the
Southeys
Well I dont like the wind Makes me nervous
Nobody likes wind for very long It makes animals nervous and restless too I dont know
whether you noticed but a little farther up the valley theyre planting windbreaks of gum trees
Eucalyptuscomes from Australia They say the gums grow ten feet a year Why dont you try a
few rows and see what happens In time they should back up the wind a little and they make
grand firewood
Good idea Adam said What I really want is water This wind would pump all the water I
could find I thought if I could bring in a few wells and irrigate the topsoil wouldnt blow away I
might try some beans
Samuel suinted into the wind Ill try to get you water if you want he said And Ive got a
little pump I made that will bring it up fast Its my own invention A windmill is a pretty costly
thing Maybe I could build them for you and save you some money
Thats good said Adam I wouldnt mind the wind if it worked for me And if I could get
water I might plant alfalfa
Its never brought much of a price
I wasnt thinking of that Few weeks ago I took a drive up around Greenfield and Gonzales
Some Swiss have moved in there Theyve got nice little dairy herds and they get four crops of
alfalfa a year
I heard about them They brought in Swiss cows Adams face was bright with plans Thats
what I want to do Sell butter and cheese and feed the milk to pigs
Youre going to bring credit to the valley Samuels said Youre going to be a real joy to the
future
If I can get water
Ill get you water if theres any to be got Ill find it I brought my magic wand He patted a
forked stick tied to his saddle
Adam pointed to the left where a wide flat place was covered with a low growth of sagebrush
Now then he said thirtysix acres and almost level as a floor I put an auger down Topsoil
averages three and a half feet sand on top and loam within plow reach Think you could get
water there
I dont know Samuel said Ill see He dismounted handed his reins to Adam and untied
his forked wand He took the forks in his two hands and walked slowly his arms out and
stretched before him and the wand tip up His steps took a zigzag course Once he frowned and
backed up a few steps then shook his head and went on Adam rode slowly behind leading the
other horse
Adam kept his eyes on the stick He saw it uiver and then jerk a little as though an invisible fish
were tugging at a line Samuels face was taut with attention He continued on until the point of
the wand seemed to be pulled strongly downward against his straining arms He made a slow
circle broke off a piece of sagebrush and dropped it on the ground He moved well outside his
circle held up his stick again and moved inward toward his marker As he came near it the point
of the stick was drawn down again Samuel sighed and relaxed and dropped his wand on the
ground I can get water here he said And not very deep The pull was strong plenty of water
Good said Adam I want to show you a couple more places
Samuel whittled out a stout piece of sagewood and drove it into the soil He made a split on the
top and fitted a crosspiece on for a mark Then he kicked the brittle brush down in the area so he
could find his marker again
On a second try three hundred yards away the wand seemed nearly torn downward out of his
hands Now theres a whole world of water here he said
The third try was not so productive After half an hour he had only the slightest sign
The two men rode slowly back toward the Trask house The afternoon was golden for the yellow
dust in the sky gilded the light As always the wind began to drop as the day waned but it
sometimes took half the night for the dust to settle out of the air I knew it was a good place
Samuel said Anyone can see that But I didnt know it was that good You must have a great
drain under your land from the mountains You know how to pick land Mr Trask
Adam smiled We had a farm in Connecticut he said For six generations we dug stones out
One of the first things I remember is sledding stones over to the walls I thought that was the way
all farms were Its strange to me and almost sinful here If you wanted a stone youd have to go
a long way for it
The ways of sin are curious Samuel observed I guess if a man had to shuck off everything he
had inside and out hed manage to hide a few little sins somewhere for his own discomfort
Theyre the last things well give up
Maybe thats a good thing to keep us humble The fear of God in us
I guess so said Samuel And I guess humility must be a good thing since its a rare man who
has not a piece of it but when you look at humbleness its hard to see where its value rests unless
you grant that it is a pleasurable pain and very precious SufferingI wonder has it been
properly looked at
Tell me about your stick Adam said How does it work
Samuel stroked the fork now tied to his saddle strings I dont really believe in it save that it
works He smiled at Adam Maybe its this way Maybe I know where the water is feel it in
my skin Some people have a gift in this direction or that Supposewell call it humility or a
deep disbelief in myself forced me to do a magic to bring up to the surface the thing I know
anyway Does that make any sense to you
Id have to think about it said Adam
The horses picked their own way heads hung low reins loosened against the bits
Can you stay the night Adam asked
I can but better not I didnt tell Liza Id be away the night Id not like to give her a worry
But she knows where you are
Sure she knows But Ill ride home tonight It doesnt matter the time If youd like to ask me to
supper Id be glad And when do you want me to start on the wells
Nowas soon as you can
You know its no cheap thing indulging yourself with water Id have to charge you fifty cents
or more a foot depending on what we find down there It can run into money
I have the money I want the wells Look Mr Hamilton
Samuel would be easier
Look Samuel I mean to make a garden of my land Remember my name is Adam So far Ive
had no Eden let alone been driven out
Its the best reason I ever heard for making a garden Samuel exclaimed He chuckled Where
will the orchard be
Adam said I wont plant apples That would be looking for accidents
What does Eve say to that She has a say you remember And Eves delight in apples
Not this one Adams eyes were shining You dont know this Eve Shell celebrate my
choice I dont think anyone can know her goodness
You have a rarity Right now I cant recall any greater gift
They were coming near to the entrance to the little side valley in which was the Sanchez house
They could see the rounded green tops of the great live oaks
Gift Adam said softly You cant know No one can know I had a gray life Mr Hamilton
Samuel Not that it was bad compared to other lives but it was nothing I dont know why I tell
you this
Maybe because I like to hear
My motherdiedbefore my memory My stepmother was a good woman but troubled and ill
My father was a stern fine manmaybe a great man
You couldnt love him
I had the kind of feeling you have in church and not a little fear in it
Samuel nodded I knowand some men want that He smiled ruefully Ive always wanted
the other Liza says its the weak thing in me
My father put me in the army in the West against the Indians
You told me But you dont think like a military man
I wasnt a good one I seem to be telling you everything
You must want to Theres always a reason
A soldier must want to do the things we had to door at least be satisfied with them I couldnt
find good enough reasons for killing men and women nor understand the reasons when they were
explained
They rode on in silence for a time Adam went on I came out of the army like dragging myself
muddy out of a swamp I wandered for a long time before going home to a remembered place I
did not love
Your father
He died and home was a place to sit around or work around waiting for death the way you
might wait for a dreadful picnic
Alone
No I have a brother
Where is hewaiting for the picnic
Yesyes thats exactly what Then Cathy came Maybe I will tell you some time when I can
tell and you want to hear
Ill want to hear Samuel said I eat stories like grapes
A kind of light spread out from her And everything changed color And the world opened out
And a day was good to awaken to And there were no limits to anything And the people of the
world were good and handsome And I was not afraid any more
I recognize it Samuel said Thats an old friend of mine It never dies but sometimes it moves
away or you do Yes thats my acuaintanceeyes nose mouth and hair
All this coming out of a little hurt girl
And not out of you
Oh no or it would have come before No Cathy brought it and it lives around her And now
Ive told you why I want the wells I have to repay somehow for value received Im going to
make a garden so good so beautiful that it will be a proper place for her to live and a fitting
place for her light to shine on
Samuel swallowed several times and he spoke with a dry voice out of a pinchedup throat I can
see my duty he said I can see it plainly before me if I am any kind of man any kind of friend
to you
Samuel said satirically Its my duty to take this thing of yours and kick it in the face then raise
it up and spread slime on it thick enough to blot out its dangerous light His voice grew strong
with vehemence I should hold it up to you muckcovered and show you its dirt and danger I
should warn you to look closer until you can see how ugly it really is I should ask you to think of
inconstancy and give you examples I should give you Othellos handkerchief Oh I know I
should And I should straighten out your tangled thoughts show you that the impulse is gray as
lead and rotten as a dead cow in wet weather If I did my duty well I could give you back your
bad old life and feel good about it and welcome you back to the musty membership in the lodge
Are you joking Maybe I shouldnt have told
It is the duty of a friend I had a friend who did the duty once for me But Im a false friend Ill
get no credit for it among my peers Its a lovely thing preserve it and glory in it And Ill dig
your wells if I have to drive my rig to the black center of the earth Ill sueeze water out like
juice from an orange
They rode under the great oaks and toward the house Adam said There she is sitting outside
He shouted Cathy he says theres waterlots of it Aside he said excitedly Did you know
shes going to have a baby
Even at this distance she looks beautiful Samuel said
Because the day had been hot Lee set a table outside under an oak tree and as the sun neared the
western mountains he padded back and forth from the kitchen carrying the cold meats pickles
potato salad coconut cake and peach pie which were supper In the center of the table he placed
a gigantic stoneware pitcher full of milk
Adam and Samuel came from the wash house their hair and faces shining with water and
Samuels beard was fluffy after its soaping They stood at the trestle table and waited until Cathy
came out
She walked slowly picking her way as though she were afraid she would fall Her full skirt and
apron concealed to a certain extent her swelling abdomen Her face was untroubled and childlike
and she clasped her hands in front of her She had reached the table before she looked up and
glanced from Samuel to Adam
Adam held her chair for her You havent met Mr Hamilton dear he said
She held out her hand How do you do she said
Samuel had been inspecting her Its a beautiful face he said Im glad to meet you You are
well I hope
Oh yes Yes Im well
The men sat down She makes it formal whether she wants to or not Every meal is a kind of
occasion Adam said
Dont talk like that she said It isnt true
Doesnt it feel like a party to you Samuel he asked
It does so and I can tell you theres never been such a candidate for a party as I am And my
childrentheyre worse My boy Tom wanted to come today Hes spoiling to get off the ranch
Samuel suddenly realized that he was making his speech last to prevent silence from falling on
the table He paused and the silence dropped Cathy looked down at her plate while she ate a
sliver of roast lamb She looked up as she put it between her small sharp teeth Her wideset eyes
communicated nothing Samuel shivered
It isnt cold is it Adam asked
Cold No A goose walked over my grave I guess
Oh yes I know that feeling
The silence fell again Samuel waited for some speech to start up knowing in advance that it
would not
Do you like our valley Mrs Trask
What Oh yes
If it isnt impertinent to ask when is your baby due
In about six weeks Adam said My wife is one of those paragonsa woman who does not
talk very much
Sometimes a silence tells the most said Samuel and he saw Cathys eyes leap up and down
again and it seemed to him that the scar on her forehead grew darker Something had flicked her
the way youd flick a horse with the braided string popper on a buggy whip Samuel couldnt
recall what he had said that had made her give a small inward start He felt a tenseness coming
over him that was somewhat like the feeling he had just before the water wand pulled down an
awareness of something strange and strained He glanced at Adam and saw that he was looking
raptly at his wife Whatever was strange was not strange to Adam His face had happiness on it
Cathy was chewing a piece of meat chewing with her front teeth Samuel had never seen anyone
chew that way before And when she had swallowed her little tongue flicked around her lips
Samuels mind repeated Somethingsomethingcant find what it is Something wrong and
the silence hung on the table
There was a shuffle behind him He turned Lee set a teapot on the table and shuffled away
Samuel began to talk to push the silence away He told how he had first come to the valley fresh
from Ireland but within a few words neither Cathy nor Adam was listening to him To prove it
he used a trick he had devised to discover whether his children were listening when they begged
him to read to them and would not let him stop He threw in two sentences of nonsense There
was no response from either Adam or Cathy He gave up
He bolted his supper drank his tea scalding hot and folded his napkin Maam if youll excuse
me Ill ride off home And I thank you for your hospitality
Good night she said
Adam jumped to his feet He seemed torn out of a reverie Dont go now I hoped to persuade
you to stay the night
No thank you but that I cant And its not a long ride I thinkof course I knowtherell be a
moon
When will you start the wells
Ill have to get my rig together do a piece of sharpening and put my house in order In a few
days Ill send the euipment with Tom
The life was flowing back into Adam Make it soon he said I want it soon Cathy were
going to make the most beautiful place in the world Therell be nothing like it anywhere
Samuel switched his gaze to Cathys face It did not change The eyes were flat and the mouth
with its small upcurve at the corners was carven
That will be nice she said
For just a moment Samuel had an impulse to do or say something to shock her out of her
distance He shivered again
Another goose Adam asked
Another goose The dusk was falling and already the tree forms were dark against the sky
Good night then
Ill walk down with you
No stay with your wife You havent finished your supper
But I
Sit down man I can find my own horse and if I cant Ill steal one of yours Samuel pushed
Adam gently down in his chair Good night Good night Good night maam He walked
uickly toward the shed
Old platterfoot Doxology was daintily nibbling hay from the manger with lips like two
flounders The halter chain clinked against wood Samuel lifted down his saddle from the big nail
where it hung by one wooden stirrup and swung it over the broad back He was lacing the latigo
through the cinch rings when there was a small stir behind him He turned and saw the silhouette
of Lee against the last light from the open shadows
When you come back the Chinese asked softly
I dont know In a few days or a week Lee what is it
What is what
By God I got creepy Is there something wrong here
You know damn well what I mean
Chinee boy jus workeenot hear not talkee
Yes I guess youre right Sure youre right Sorry I asked you It wasnt very good manners
He turned back slipped the bit in Doxs mouth and laced the big flop ears into the headstall He
slipped the halter and dropped it in the manger Good night Lee he said
Mr Hamilton
Do you need a cook
On my place I cant afford a cook
Id work cheap
Liza would kill you Whyyou want to uit
Just thought Id ask said Lee Good night
Adam and Cathy sat in the gathering dark under the tree
Hes a good man Adam said I like him I wish I could persuade him to take over here and run
this placekind of superintendent
Cathy said Hes got his own place and his own family
Yes I know And its the poorest land you ever saw He could make more at wages from me Ill
ask him It does take a time to get used to a new country Its like being born again and having to
learn all over I used to know from what uarter the rains came Its different here And once I
knew in my skin whether wind would blow when it would be cold But Ill learn It just takes a
little time Are you comfortable Cathy
One day and not too far away youll see the whole valley green with alfalfasee it from the
fine big windows of the finished house Ill plant rows of gum trees and Im going to send away
for seeds and plantsput in a kind of experimental farm I might try lichee nuts from China I
wonder if they would grow here Well I can try Maybe Lee could tell me And once the babys
born you can ride over the whole place with me You havent really seen it Did I tell you Mr
Hamilton is going to put up windmills and well be able to see them turning from here He
stretched his legs out comfortably under the table Lee should bring candles he said I
wonder whats keeping him
Cathy spoke very uietly Adam I didnt want to come here I am not going to stay here As
soon as I can I will go away
Oh nonsense He laughed Youre like a child away from home for the first time Youll love
it once you get used to it and the baby is born You know when I first went away to the army I
thought I was going to die of homesickness But I got over it We all get over it So dont say silly
things like that
Its not a silly thing
Dont talk about it dear Everything will change after the baby is born Youll see Youll see
He clasped his hands behind his head and looked up at the faint stars through the tree branches
Samuel Hamilton rode back home in a night so flooded with moonlight that the hills took on the
uality of the white and dusty moon The trees and earth were moondry silent and airless and
dead The shadows were black without shading and the open places white without color Here
and there Samuel could see secret movement for the moonfeeders were at workthe deer
which browse all night when the moon is clear and sleep under thickets in the day Rabbits and
field mice and all other small hunted that feel safer in the concealing light crept and hopped and
crawled and froze to resemble stones or small bushes when ear or nose suspected danger The
predators were working toothe long weasels like waves of brown light the cobby wildcats
crouching near to the ground almost invisible except when their yellow eyes caught light and
flashed for a second the foxes sniffling with pointed upraised noses for a warmblooded supper
the raccoons padding near still water talking frogs The coyotes nuzzled along the slopes and
torn with sorrowjoy raised their heads and shouted their feeling half keen half laughter at
their goddess moon And over all the shadowy screech owls sailed drawing a smudge of
shadowy fear below them on the ground The wind of the afternoon was gone and only a little
breeze like a sigh was stirred by the restless thermals of the warm dry hills
Doxologys loud offbeat hoofsteps silenced the night people until after he had passed Samuels
beard glinted white and his graying hair stood up high on his head He had hung his black hat on
his saddle horn An ache was on the top of his stomach an apprehension that was like a sick
thought It was a Weltschmerzwhich we used to call Welshratsthe world sadness that rises
into the soul like a gas and spreads despair so that you probe for the offending event and can find
none
Samuel went back in his mind over the fine ranch and the indications of waterno Welshrats
could come out of that unless he sheltered a submerged envy He looked in himself for envy and
could find none He went on to Adams dream of a garden like Eden and to Adams adoration of
Cathy Nothing there unlessunless his secret mind brooded over his own healed loss But that
was so long ago he had forgotten the pain The memory was mellow and warm and comfortable
now that it was all over His loins and his thighs had forgotten hunger
As he rode through the light and dark of treeshade and open his mind moved on When had the
Welshrats started crawling in his chest He found it thenand it was Cathy pretty tiny delicate
Cathy But what about her She was silent but many women were silent What was it Where
had it come from He remembered that he had felt an imminence akin to the one that came to him
when he held the water wand And he remembered the shivers when the goose walked over his
grave Now he had pinned it down in time and place and person It had come at dinner and it had
come from Cathy
He built her face in front of him and studied her wideset eyes delicate nostrils mouth smaller
than he liked but sweet small firm chin and back to her eyes Were they cold Was it her eyes
He was circling to the point The eyes of Cathy had no message no communication of any kind
There was nothing recognizable behind them They were not human eyes They reminded him of
somethingwhat was itsome memory some picture He strove to find it and then it came of
itself
It rose out of the years complete with all its colors and its cries its crowded feelings He saw
himself a very little boy so small that he had to reach high for his fathers hand He felt the
cobbles of Londonderry under his feet and the crush and gaiety of the one big city he had seen A
fair it was with puppet shows and stalls of produce and horses and sheep penned right in the
street for sale or trade or auction and other stalls of brightcolored knickknackery desirable and
because his father was gay almost possessable
And then the people turned like a strong river and they were carried along a narrow street as
though they were chips on a flood tide pressure at chest and back and the feet keeping up The
narrow street opened out to a suare and against the gray wall of a building there was a high
structure of timbers and a noosed rope hanging down
Samuel and his father were pushed and bunted by the water of people pushed closer and closer
He could hear in his memory ear his father saying Its no thing for a child Its no thing for
anybody but less for a child His father struggled to turn to force his way back against the flood
wave of people Let us out Please let us out Ive a child here
The wave was faceless and it pushed without passion Samuel raised his head to look at the
structure A group of darkclothed darkhatted men had climbed up on the high platform And in
their midst was a man with golden hair dressed in dark trousers and a light blue shirt open at the
throat Samuel and his father were so close that the boy had to raise his head high to see
The golden man seemed to have no arms He looked out over the crowd and then looked down
looked right at Samuel The picture was clear lighted and perfect The mans eyes had no depth
they were not like other eyes not like the eyes of a man
Suddenly there was uick movement on the platform and Samuels father put both his hands on
the boys head so that his palms cupped over the ears and his fingers met behind The hands
forced Samuels head down and forced his face tight in against his fathers black best coat
Struggle as he would he could not move his head He could see only a band of light around the
edges of his eyes and only a muffled roar of sound came to his ears through his fathers hands He
heard heartbeats in his hears Then he felt his fathers hands and arms grow rigid with set
muscles and against his face he could feel his fathers deepcaught breathing and then deep
intake and held breath and his fathers hands trembling
A little more there was to it and he dug it up and set it before his eyes in the air ahead of the
horses heada worn and battered table at a pub loud talk and laughter A pewter mug was in
front of his father and a cup of hot milk sweet and aromatic with sugar and cinnamon before
himself His fathers lips were curiously blue and there were tears in his fathers eyes
Id never have brought you if Id known Its not fit for any man to see and sure not for a small
boy
I didnt see any Samuel piped You held my head down
Im glad of that
What was it
Ill have to tell you They were killing a bad man
Was it the golden man
Yes it was And you must put no sorrow on him He had to be killed Not once but many times
he did dreadful thingsthings only a fiend could think of Its not his hanging sorrows me but
that they make a holiday of it that should be done secretly in the dark
I saw the golden man He looked right down at me
For that even more I thank God hes gone
What did he do
Ill never tell you nightmare things
He had the strangest eyes the golden man They put me in mind of a goats eyes
Drink your sweetymilk and you shall have a stick with ribbons and a long whistle like silver
And the shiny box with a picture into it
That also so you drink up your sweetymilk and beg no more
There it was mined out of the dusty past
Doxology was climbing the last rise before the hollow of the home ranch and the big feet
stumbled over stones in the roadway
It was the eyes of course Samuel thought Only twice in my life have I seen eyes like thatnot
like human eyes And he thought Its the night and the moon Now what connection under
heaven can there be between the golden man hanged so long ago and the sweet little bearing
mother Lizas right My imagination will get me a passport to hell one day Let me dig this
nonsense out else Ill be searching that poor child for evil This is how we can get trapped Now
think hard and then lose it Some accident of eye shape and eye color it is But no thats not it
Its a look and has no reference to shape or color Well why is a look evil then Maybe such a
look may have been sometime on a holy face Now stop this romancing and never let it trouble
againever He shivered Ill have to set up a goose fence around my grave he thought
And Samuel Hamilton resolved to help greatly with the Salinas Valley Eden to make a secret
guiltpayment for his ugly thoughts
Liza Hamilton her apple cheeks flaming red moved like a caged leopard in front of the stove
when Samuel came into the kitchen in the morning The oakwood fire roared up past an open
damper to heat the oven for the bread which lay white and rising in the pans Liza had been up
before dawn She always was It was just as sinful to her to lie abed after light as it was to be
abroad after dark There was no possible virtue in either Only one person in the world could with
impunity and without crime lie between her crisp ironed sheets after dawn after sunup even to
the far reaches of midmorning and that was her youngest and last born Joe Only Tom and Joe
lived on the ranch now And Tom big and red already cultivating a fine flowing mustache sat at
the kitchen table with his sleeves rolled down as he had been mannered Liza poured thick batter
from a pitcher onto a soapstone griddle The hot cakes rose like little hassocks and small
volcanos formed and erupted on them until they were ready to be turned A cheerful brown they
were with tracings of darker brown And the kitchen was full of the good sweet smell of them
Samuel came in from the yard where he had been washing himself His face and beard gleamed
with water and he turned down the sleeves of his blue shirt as he entered the kitchen Rolledup
sleeves at the table were not acceptable to Mrs Hamilton They indicated either an ignorance or
a flouting of the niceties
Im late Mother Samuel said
She did not look around at him Her spatula moved like a striking snake and the hot cakes settled
their white sides hissing on the soapstone What time was it you came home she asked
Oh it was latelate Must have been near eleven I didnt look fearing to waken you
I did not waken Liza said grimly And maybe you can find it healthy to rove all night but the
Lord God will do what He sees fit about that It was well known that Liza Hamilton and the
Lord God held similar convictions on nearly every subject She turned and reached and a plate of
crisp hot cakes lay between Toms hands How does the Sanchez place look she asked
Samuel went to his wife leaned down from his height and kissed her round red cheek Good
morning Mother Give me your blessing
Bless you said Liza automatically
Samuel sat down at the table and said Bless you Tom Well Mr Trask is making great
changes Hes fitting up the old house to live in
Liza turned sharply from the stove The one where the cows and pigs have slept the years
Oh hes ripped out the floors and window casings All new and new painted
Hell never get the smell of pigs out Liza said firmly Theres a pungency left by a pig that
nothing can wash out or cover up
Well I went inside and looked around Mother and I could smell nothing except paint
When the paint dries youll smell pig she said
Hes got a garden laid out with spring water running through it and hes set a place apart for
flowers roses and the like and some of the bushes are coming clear from Boston
I dont see how the Lord God puts up with such waste she said grimly Not that I dont like a
rose myself
He said hed try to root some cuttings for me Samuel said
Tom finished his hot cakes and stirred his coffee What kind of a man is he Father
Well I think hes a fine manhas a good tongue and a fair mind Hes given to dreaming
Hear now the pot blackguarding the kettle Liza interrupted
I know Mother I know But have you ever thought that my dreaming takes the place of
something I havent Mr Trask has practical dreams and the sweet dollars to make them solid
He wants to make a garden of his land and he will do it too
Whats his wife like Liza asked
Well shes very young and very pretty Shes uiet hardly speaks but then shes having her
first baby soon
I know that Liza said What was her name before
I dont know
Well where did she come from
She put his plate of hot cakes in front of him and poured coffee in his cup and refilled Toms cup
What did you learn then How does she dress
Why very nice prettya blue dress and a little coat pink but tight about the waist
Youve an eye for that Would you say they were made clothes or store bought
Oh I think store bought
You would not know Liza said firmly You thought the traveling suit Dessie made to go to
San Jose was store bought
Dessies the clever love said Samuel A needle sings in her hands
Tom said Dessies thinking of opening a dressmaking shop in Salinas
She told me Samuel said Shed make a great success of it
Salinas Liza put her hands on her hips Dessie didnt tell me
Im afraid weve done bad service to our dearie Samuel said Here she wanted to save it for a
real tinplate surprise to her mother and weve leaked it like wheat from a mousehole sack
She might have told me said Liza I dont like surprises Well go onwhat was she doing
Who
Why Mrs Trask of course
Doing Why sitting sitting in a chair under an oak tree Her times not far
Her hands Samuel her handswhat was she doing with her hands
Samuel searched his memory Nothing I guess I remembershe had little hands and she held
them clasped in her lap
Liza sniffed Not sewing not mending not knitting
No Mother
I dont know that its a good idea for you to go over there Riches and idleness devils tools
and youve not a very sturdy resistance
Samuel raised his head and laughed with pleasure Sometimes his wife delighted him but he
could never tell her how Its only the riches Ill be going there for Liza I meant to tell you after
breakfast so you could sit down to hear He wants me to bore four or five wells for him and
maybe put windmills and storage tanks
Is it all talk Is it a windmill turned by water Will he pay you or will you come back excusing
as usual Hell pay when his crop comes in  she mimicked  Hell pay when his rich uncle
dies Its my experience Samuel and should be yours that if they dont pay presently they
never pay at all We could buy a valley farm with your promises
Adam Trask will pay said Samuel Hes well fixed His father left him a fortune Its a whole
winter of work Mother Well lay something by and well have a Christmas to scrape the stars
Hell pay fifty cents a foot and the windmills Mother I can make everything but the casings
right here Ill need the boys to help I want to take Tom and Joe
Joe cant go she said You know hes delicate
I thought I might scrape off some of his delicacy He can starve on delicacy
Joe cant go she said finally And who is to run the ranch while you and Tom are gone
I thought Id ask George to come back He doesnt like a clerks job even if it is in King City
Like it he may not but he can take a measure of discomfort for eight dollars a week
Mother Samuel cried heres our chance to scratch our name in the First National Bank
Dont throw the weight of your tongue in the path of fortune Please Mother
She grumbled to herself all morning over her work while Tom and Samuel went over the boring
euipment sharpened bits drew sketches of windmills new in design and measured for timbers
and redwood water tanks In the midmorning Joe came out to join them and he became so
fascinated that he asked Samuel to let him go
Samuel said Offhand Id say Im against it Joe Your mother needs you here
But I want to go Father And dont forget next year Ill be going to college in Palo Alto And
thats going away isnt it Please let me go Ill work hard
Im sure you would if you could come But Im against it And when you talk to your mother
about it Ill thank you to let it slip that Im against it You might even throw in that I refused
Joe grinned and Tom laughed aloud
Will you let her persuade you Tom asked
Samuel scowled at his sons Im a hardopinioned man he said Once Ive set my mind oxen
cant stir me Ive looked at it from all angles and my word isJoe cant go You wouldnt want
to make a liar of my word would you
Ill go in and talk to her now said Joe
Now son take it easy Samuel called after him Use your head Let her do most of it
Meanwhile Ill set my stubborn up
Two days later the big wagon pulled away loaded with timbers and tackle Tom drove four
hordes and beside him Samuel and Joe sat swinging their feet
When I said Cathy was a monster it seemed to me that it was so Now I have bent close with a
glass over the small print of her and reread the footnotes and I wonder if it was true The trouble
is that since we cannot know what she wanted we will never know whether or not she got it If
rather than running toward something she ran away from something we cant know whether she
escaped Who knows but that she tried to tell someone or everyone what she was like and could
not for lack of a common language Her life may have been her language formal developed
indecipherable It is easy to say she was bad but there is little meaning unless we know why
Ive built the image in my mind of Cathy sitting uietly waiting for her pregnancy to be over
living on a farm she did not like with a man she did not love
She sat in her chair under the oak tree her hands clasped each to each in love and shelter She
grew very bigabnormally big even at a time when women gloried in big babies and counted
extra pounds with pride She was misshapen her belly tight and heavy and distended made it
impossible for her to stand without supporting herself with her hands But the great lump was
local Shoulders neck arms hands face were unaffected slender and girlish Her breasts did not
grow and her nipples did not darken There was no uickening of milk glands no physical
planning to feed the newborn When she sat behind a table you could not see that she was
pregnant at all
In that day there was no measuring of pelvic arch no testing of blood no building with calcium
A woman gave a tooth for a child It was the law And a woman was likely to have strange
tastes some said for filth and it was set down to the Eve nature still under sentence for original
sin
Cathys odd appetite was simple compared to some The carpenters repairing the old house
complained that they could not keep the lumps of chalk with which they coated their chalk lines
Again and again the scored hunks disappeared Cathy stole them and broke them in little pieces
She carried the chips in her apron pocket and when no one was about she crushed the soft lime
between her teeth She spoke very little Her eyes were remote It was as though she had gone
away leaving a breathing doll to conceal her absence
Activity surged around her Adam went happily about building and planning his Eden Samuel
and his boys brought in a well at forty feet and put down the newfangled expensive metal casing
for Adam wanted the best
The Hamiltons moved their rig and started another hole They slept in a tent beside the work and
cooked over a campfire But there was always one or another of them riding home for a tool or
with a message
Adam fluttered like a bewildered bee confused by too many flowers He sat by Cathy and chatted
about the pieplant roots just come in He sketched for her the new fan blade Samuel had invented
for the windmill It had a variable pitch and was an unheardof thing He rode out to the well rig
and slowed the work with his interest And naturally as he discussed wells with Cathy his talk
was all of birth and child care at the well head It was a good time for Adam the best time He
was the king of his wide and spacious life And summer passed into a hot and fragrant autumn
The Hamiltons at the well rig had finished their lunch of Lizas bread and rat cheese and
venomous coffee cooked in a can over the fire Joes eyes were heavy and he was considering
how he could get away into the brush to sleep for a while
Samuel knelt in the sandy soil looking at the torn and broken edges of his bit Just before they
had stopped for lunch the drill had found something thirty feet down that had mangled the steel as
though it were lead Samuel scraped the edge of the blade with his pocketknife and inspected the
scrapings in the palm of his hand His eyes shone with a childlike excitement He held out his
hand and poured the scrapings into Toms hand
Take a look at it son What do you think it is
Joe wandered over from his place in front of the tent Tom studied the fragments in his hand
Whatever it is its hard he said Couldnt be a diamond that big Looks like metal Do you
think weve bored into a buried locomotive
His father laughed Thirty feet down he said admiringly
It looks like tool steel said Tom We havent got anything that can touch it Then he saw the
faraway joyous look on his fathers face and a shiver of shared delight came to him The
Hamilton children loved it when their fathers mind went free Then the world was peopled with
wonders
Samuel said Metal you say You think steel Tom Im going to make a guess and then Im
going to get an assay Now hear my guessand remember it I think well find nickel in it and
silver maybe and carbon and manganese How I would like to dig it up Its in sea sand Thats
what weve been getting
Tom said Say what do you think it is withnickel and silver
It must have been long thousand centuries ago Samuel said and his sons knew he was seeing
it Maybe it was all water herean inland sea with the seabirds circling and crying And it
would have been a pretty thing if it happened at night There would come a line of light and then
a pencil of white light and then a tree of blinding light drawn in a long arc from heaven Then
thered be a great water spout and a big mushroom of steam And your ears would be staggered
by the sound because the soaring cry of its coming would be on you at the same time the water
exploded And then it would be black night again because of the blinding light And gradually
youd see the killed fish coming up showing silver in the starlight and the crying birds would
come to eat them Its a lonely lovely thing to think about isnt it
He made them see it as he always did
Tom said softly You think its a meteorite dont you
That I do and we can prove it by assay
Joe said eagerly Lets dig it up
You dig it Joe while we bore for water
Tom said seriously If the assay showed enough nickel and silver wouldnt it pay to mine it
Youre my own son said Samuel We dont know whether its big as a house or little as a hat
But we could probe down and see
That we could if we did it secretly and hid our thinking under a pot
Why what do you mean
Now Tom have you no kindness toward your mother We give her enough trouble son Shes
told me plain that if I spend any more money patenting things shell give us trouble to remember
Have pity on her Cant you see her shame when they ask her what were doing Shes a truthful
woman your mother Shed have to say Theyre at digging up a star  He laughed happily
Shed never live it down And shed make us smart No pies for three months
Tom said We cant get through it Well have to move to another place
Ill put some blasting powder down said his father and if that doesnt crack it aside well
start a new hole He stood up Ill have to go home for powder and to sharpen the drill Why
dont you boys ride along with me and well give Mother a surprise so that shell cook the whole
night and complain That way shell dissemble her pleasure
Joe said Somebodys coming coming fast And indeed they could see a horseman riding
toward them at full gallop but a curious horseman who flopped about on his mount like a tied
chicken When he came a little closer they saw that it was Lee his elbows waving like wings his
ueue lashing about like a snake It was surprising that he stayed on at all and still drove the
horse at full tilt He pulled up breathing heavily Missy Adam say come Missy Cathy bad
come uick Missy yell scream
Samuel said Hold on Lee When did it start
Mebbe bleakfus time
All right Calm yourself How is Adam
Missy Adam clazy Clylaughmake vomit
Sure said Samuel These new fathers I was one once Tom throw a saddle on for me will
Joe said What is it
Why Mrs Trask is about to have her baby I told Adam Id stand by
You Joe asked
Samuel leveled his eyes on his youngest son I brought both of you into the world he said
And youve given no evidence you think I did a bad service to the world Tom you get all the
tools gathered up And go back to the ranch and sharpen the metal Bring back the box of powder
thats on the shelf in the tool shed and go easy with it as you love your arms and legs Joe I want
you to stay here and look after things
Joe said plaintively But what will I do here alone
Samuel was silent for a moment Then he said Joe do you love me
Why sure
If you heard Id committed some great crime would you turn me over to the police
What are you talking about
Would you
All right then In my basket under my clothes youll find two booksnew so be gentle with
them Its two volumes by a man the world is going to hear from You can start reading if you
want and it will raise up your lid a little Its called The Principles of Psychology and its by an
Eastern man named William James No relative to the train robber And Joe if you ever let on
about the books Ill run you off the ranch If your mother ever found out I spent the money on
them shed run me off the ranch
Tom led a saddled horse to him Can I read it next
Yes said Samuel and he slipped his leg lightly over the saddle Come on Lee
The Chinese wanted to break into a gallop but Samuel restrained him Take it easy Lee
Birthing takes longer than you think mostly
For a time they rode in silence and then Lee said Im sorry you bought those books I have the
condensed form in one volume the textbook You could have borrowed it
Have you now Do you have many books
Not many herethirty or forty But youre welcome to any of them you havent read
Thank you Lee And you may be sure Ill look the first moment I can You know you could
talk to my boys Joes a little flighty but Toms all right and it would do him good
Its a hard bridge to cross Mr Hamilton Makes me timid to talk to a new person but Ill try if
you say so
They walked the horses rapidly toward the little draw of the Trask place Samuel said Tell me
how is it with the mother
Id rather you saw for yourself and thought for yourself Lee said You know when a man
lives alone as much as I do his mind can go off on an irrational tangent just because his social
world is out of kilter
Yes I know But Im not lonely and Im on a tangent too But maybe not the same one
You dont think I imagine it then
I dont know what it is but Ill tell you for your reassurance that Ive a sense of strangeness
I guess thats all it is with me too said Lee He smiled Ill tell you how far it got with me
though Since Ive come here I find myself thinking of Chinese fairy tales my father told me We
Chinese have a welldeveloped demonology
You think she is a demon
Of course not said Lee I hope Im a little beyond such silliness I dont know what it is You
know Mr Hamilton a servant develops an ability to taste the wind and judge the climate of the
house he works in And theres a strangeness here Maybe thats what makes me remember my
fathers demons
Did your father believe in them
Oh no He thought I should know the background You Occidentals perpetuate a good many
myths too
Samuel said Tell me what happened to set you off This morning I mean
If you werent coming I would try said Lee But I would rather not You can see for yourself
I may be crazy Of course Mr Adam is strung so tight he may snap like a banjo string
Give me a little hint It might save time What did she do
Nothing Thats just it Mr Hamilton Ive been at births before a good many of them but this
is something new to me
ItswellIll tell you the one thing I can think of This is much more like a bitter deadly
combat than a birth
As they rode into the draw and under the oak trees Samuel said I hope you havent got me in a
state Lee Its a strange day and I dont know why
No wind said Lee Its the first day in a month when there hasnt been wind in the afternoon
Thats so You know Ive been so close to the details Ive paid no attention to the clothing of the
day First we find a buried star and now we go to dig up a mintnew human He looked up
through the oak branches at the yellowlit hills What a beautiful day to be born in he said If
signs have their fingers on a life its a sweet life coming And Lee if Adam plays true hell be
in the way Stay close will you In case I need something Look the men the carpenters are
sitting under that tree
Mr Adam stopped the work He thought the hammering might disturb his wife
Samuel said You stay close That sounds like Adam playing true He doesnt know his wife
probably couldnt hear God Himself beating a tattoo on the sky
The workmen sitting under the tree waved to him How do Mr Hamilton Hows your family
Fine fine Say isnt that Rabbit Holman Whereve you been Rabbit
Went prospecting Mr Hamilton
Find anything Rabbit
Hell Mr Hamilton I couldnt even find the mule I went out with
They rode on toward the house Lee said uickly If you ever get a minute Id like to show you
something
What is it Lee
Well Ive been trying to translate some old Chinese poetry into English Im not sure it can be
done Will you take a look
Id like to Lee Why that would be a treat for me
Bordonis white frame house was very uiet almost broodingly uiet and the shades were pulled
down Samuel dismounted at the stoop untied his bulging saddlebags and gave his horse to Lee
He knocked and got no answer and went in It was dusky in the living room after the outside
light He looked in the kitchen scrubbed to the wood grain by Lee A gray stoneware pilon
coffeepot grunted on the back of the stove Samuel tapped lightly on the bedroom door and went
in
It was almost pitchblack inside for not only were the shades down but blankets were tacked over
the windows Cathy was lying in the big fourposter bed and Adam sat beside her his face buried
in the coverlet He raised his head and looked blindly out
Samuel said pleasantly Why are you sitting in the dark
Adams voice was hoarse She doesnt want the light It hurts her eyes
Samuel walked into the room and authority grew in him with each step There will have to be
lieht he said She can close her eyes Ill tie a black cloth over them if she wants He moved to
the window and grasped the blanket to pull it down but Adam was upon him before he could
yank
Leave it The light hurts her he said fiercely
Samuel turned on him Now Adam I know what you feel I promised you Id take care of
things and I will I only hope one of those things isnt you He pulled the blanket down and
rolled up the shade to let the golden afternoon light in
Cathy made a little mewing sound from the bed and Adam went to her Close your eyes dear
Ill put a cloth over your eyes
Samuel dropped his saddlebags in a chair and stood beside the bed Adam he said firmly Im
going to ask you to go out of the room and to stay out
No I cant Why
Because I dont want you in the way Its considered a sweet practice for you to get drunk
I couldnt
Samuel said Angers a slow thing in me and disgust is slower but I can taste the beginnings of
both of them Youll get out of the room and give me no trouble or Ill go away and youll have a
basket of trouble
Adam went finally and from the doorway Samuel called And I dont want you bursting in if
you hear anything You wait for me to come out He closed the door noticed there was a key in
the lock and turned it Hes an upset vehement man he said He loves you
He had not looked at her closely until now And he saw true hatred in her eyes unforgiving
murderous hatred
Itll be over before long dearie Now tell me has the water broke
Her hostile eyes glared at him and her lips raised snarling from her little teeth She did not answer
him
He stared at her I did not come by choice except as a friend he said Its not a pleasure to me
young woman I dont know your trouble and minute by minute I dont care Maybe I can save
you some painwho knows Im going to ask you one more uestion If you dont answer if
you put that snarling look on me Im going out and leave you to welter
The words struck into her understanding like lead shot dropping in water She made a great effort
And it gave him a shivering to see her face change the steel leave her eyes the lips thicken from
line to bow and the corners turn up He noticed a movement of her hands the fists unclench and
the fingers turn pinkly upward Her face became young and innocent and bravely hurt It was like
one magiclantern slide taking the place of another
She said softly The water broke at dawn
Thats better Have you had hard labor
How far apart
Well Ive been in this room fifteen minutes
Ive had two little onesno big ones since you came
Fine Now wheres your linen
In that hamper over there
Youll be all right dearie he said gently
He opened his saddlebags and took out a thick rope covered with blue velvet and looped at either
end On the velvet hundreds of little pink flowers were embroidered Liza sent you her pulling
rope to use he said She made it when our firstborn was preparing What with our children and
friends this rope has pulled a great number of people into the world He slipped one of the
loops over each of the footposts of the bed
Suddenly her eyes glazed and her back arched like a spring and the blood started to her cheeks
He waited for her cry or scream and looked apprehensively at the closed door But there was no
screamonly a series of grunting sueals After a few seconds her body relaxed and the
hatefulness was back in her face
The labor struck again Theres a dear he said soothingly Was it one or two I dont know
The more you see the more you learn no two are alike Id better get my hands washed
Her head threshed from side to side Good good my darling he said I think it wont be long
till your babys here He put his hand on her forehead where her scar showed dark and angry
How did you get the hurt on your head he asked
Her head jerked up and her sharp teeth fastened on his hand across the back and up into the palm
near the little finger He cried out in pain and tried to pull his hand away but her jaw was set and
her head twisted and turned mangling his hand the way a terrier worries a sack A shrill snarling
came from her set teeth He slapped her on the cheek and it had no effect Automatically he did
what he would have done to stop a dog fight His left hand went to her throat and he cut off her
wind She struggled and tore at his hand before her jaws unclenched and he pulled his hand free
The flesh was torn and bleeding He stepped back from the bed and looked at the damage her
teeth had done He looked at her with fear And when he looked her face was calm again and
young and innocent
Im sorry she said uickly Oh Im sorry
Samuel shuddered
It was the pain she said
Samuel laughed shortly Ill have to muzzle you I guess he said A collie bitch did the same
to me once He saw the hatred look out of her eyes for a second and then retreat
Samuel said Have you got anything to put on it Humans are more poisonous than snakes
Well have you got any whisky Ill pour some whisky on it
In the second drawer
He splashed whisky on his bleeding hand and kneaded the flesh against the alcohol sting A
strong uaking was in his stomach and a sickness rose up against his eyes He took a swallow of
whisky to steady himself He dreaded to look back at the bed My hand wont be much good for
a while he said
Samuel told Adam afterward She must be made of whalebone The birth happened before I was
ready Popped like a seed Id not the water ready to wash him Why she didnt even touch the
pulling rope to bear down Pure whalebone she is He tore at the door called Lee and demanded
warm water Adam came charging into the room A boy Samuel cried Youve got a boy
Easy he said for Adam had seen the mess in the bed and a green was rising in his face
Samuel said Send Lee in here And you Adam if you still have the authority to tell your hands
and feet what to do get to the kitchen and make me some coffee And see the lamps are filled and
the chimneys clean
Adam turned like a zombie and left the room In a moment Lee looked in Samuel pointed to the
bundle in a laundry basket Sponge him off in warm water Lee Dont let a draft get on him
Lord I wish Liza were here I cant do everything at once
He turned back to the bed Now dearie Ill get you cleaned up
Cathy was bowed again snarling in her pain Itll be over in a little he said Takes a little time
for the residue And youre so uick Why you didnt even have to pull on Lizas rope He saw
something stared and went uickly to work Lord God in Heaven its another one
He worked fast and as with the first the birth was incredibly uick And again Samuel tied the
cord Lee took the second baby washed it wrapped it and put it in the basket
Samuel cleaned the mother and shifted her gently while he changed the linen on the bed He
found in himself a reluctance to look in her face He worked as uickly as he could for his bitten
hand was stiffening He drew a clean white sheet up to her chin and raised her to slip a fresh
pillow under her head At last he had to look at her
Her golden hair was wet with perspiration but her face had changed It was stony expressionless
At her throat the pulse fluttered visibly
You have two sons Samuel said Two fine sons They arent alike Each one born separate in
his own sack
She inspected him coldly and without interest
Samuel said Ill show your boys to you
No she said without emphasis
Now dearie dont you want to see your sons
No I dont want them
Oh youll change Youre tired now but youll change And Ill tell you nowthis birth was
uicker and easier than Ive seen ever in my life
The eyes moved from his face I dont want them I want you to cover the windows and take the
light away
Its weariness In a few days youll feel so different you wont remember
Ill remember Go away Take them out of the room Send Adam in
Samuel was caught by her tone There was no sickness no weariness no softness His words
came out without his will I dont like you he said and wished he could gather the words back
into his throat and into his mind But his words had no effect on Cathy
Send Adam in she said
In the little living room Adam looked vaguely at his sons and went uickly into the bedroom and
shut the door In a moment came the sound of tapping Adam was nailing the blankets over the
windows again
Lee brought coffee to Samuel Thats a badlooking hand you have there he said
I know Im afraid its going to give me trouble
Why did she do it
I dont know Shes a strange thing
Lee said Mr Hamilton let me take care of that You could lose an arm
The life went out of Samuel Do what you want Lee A frightened sorrow has closed down over
my heart I wish I were a child so I could cry Im too old to be afraid like this And Ive not felt
such despair since a bird died in my hand by a flowing water long ago
Lee left the room and shortly returned carrying a small ebony box carved with twisting dragons
He sat by Samuel and from his box took a wedgeshaped Chinese razor It will hurt he said
softly
Ill try to bear it Lee
The Chinese bit his lips feeling the inflicted pain in himself while he cut deeply into the hand
opened the flesh around the toothmarks front and back and trimmed the ragged flesh away until
good red blood flowed from every wound He shook a bottle of yellow emulsion labeled Halls
Cream Salve and poured it into the deep cuts He saturated a handkerchief with the salve and
wrapped the hand Samuel winced and gripped the chair arm with his good hand
Its mostly carbolic acid Lee said You can smell it
Thank you Lee Im being a baby to knot up like this
I dont think I could have been so uiet said Lee Ill get you another cup of coffee
He came back with two cups and sat down by Samuel I think Ill go away he said I never
went willingly to a slaughter house
Samuel stiffened What do you mean
I dont know The words came out
Samuel shivered Lee men are fools I guess I hadnt thought about it but Chinese men are
fools too
What made you doubt it
Oh maybe because we think of strangers as stronger and better than we are
What do you want to say
Samuel said Maybe the foolishness is necessary the dragon fighting the boasting the pitiful
courage to be constantly knocking a chip off Gods shoulder and the childish cowardice that
makes a ghost of a dead tree beside a darkening road Maybe thats good and necessary but
What do you want to say Lee repeated patiently
I thought some wind had blown up the embers in my foolish mind Samuel said And now I
hear in your voice that you have it too I feel wings over this house I feel a dreadfulness coming
I feel it too
I know you do and that makes me take less than my usual comfort in my foolishness This birth
was too uick too easylike a cat having kittens And I fear for these kittens I have dreadful
thoughts gnawing to get into my brain
What do you want to say Lee asked a third time
I want my wife Samuel cried No dreams no ghosts no foolishness I want her here They
say miners take canaries into the pits to test the air Liza has no truck with foolishness And Lee
if Liza sees a ghost its a ghost and not a fragment of a dream If Liza feels trouble well bar the
doors
Lee got up and went to the laundry basket and looked down at the babies He had to peer close
for the light was going fast Theyre sleeping he said
Theyll be sualling soon enough Lee will you hitch up the rig and drive to my place for Liza
Tell her I need her here If Toms still there tell him to mind the place If not Ill send him in the
morning And if Liza doesnt want to come tell her we need a womans hand here and a
womans clear eyes Shell know what you mean
Ill do it said Lee Maybe were scaring each other like two children in the dark
Ive thought of that Samuel said And Lee tell her I hurt my hand at the well head Do not
for Gods sake tell her how it happened
Ill get some lamps lit and then Ill go said Lee It will be a great relief to have her here
That it will Lee That it will Shell let some light into this cellar hole
After Lee drove away in the dark Samuel picked up a lamp in his left hand He had to set it on the
floor to turn the knob of the bedroom door The room was in pitchblackness and the yellow
lamplight streamed upward and did not light the bed
Cathys voice came strong and edged from the bed Shut the door I do not want the light
Adam go out I want to be in the darkalone
Adam said hoarsely I want to stay with you
I do not want you
I will stay
Then stay But dont talk any more Please close the door and take the lamp away
Samuel went back to the living room He put the lamp on the table by the laundry basket and
looked in on the small sleeping faces of the babies Their eyes were pinched shut and they
sniffled a little in discomfort at the light Samuel put his forefinger down and stroked the hot
foreheads One of the twins opened his mouth and yawned prodigiously and settled back to sleep
Samuel moved the lamp and then went to the front door and opened it and stepped outside The
evening star was so bright that it seemed to flare and crumple as it sank toward the western
mountains The air was still and Samuel could smell the dayheated sage The night was very
dark Samuel started when he heard a voice speaking out of the blackness
How is she
Who is it Samuel demanded
Its me Rabbit The man emerged and took form in the light from the doorway
The mother Rabbit Oh shes fine
Lee said twins
Thats righttwin sons You couldnt want better I guess Mr Trask will tear the river up by the
roots now Hell bring in a crop of candy canes
Samuel didnt know why he changed the subject Rabbit do you know what we bored into
today A meteorite
Whats that Mr Hamilton
A shooting star that fell a million years ago
You did Well think of that How did you hurt your hand
I almost said on a shooting star Samuel laughed But it wasnt that interesting I pinched it in
the tackle
Bad
No not bad
Two boys said Rabbit My old lady will be jealous
Will you come inside and sit Rabbit
No no thank you Ill get out to sleep Morning seems to come earlier every year I live
That it does Rabbit Good night then
Liza Hamilton arrived about four in the morning Samuel was asleep in his chair dreaming that
he had gripped a redhot bar of iron and could not let go Liza awakened him and looked at his
hand before she even glanced at the babies While she did well the things he had done in a
lumbering masculine way she gave him his orders and packed him off He was to get up this
instant saddle Doxology and ride straight to King City No matter what time it was he must
wake up that goodfornothing doctor and get his hand treated If it seemed all right he could go
home and wait And it was a criminal thing to leave your lastborn and he little more than a baby
himself sitting there by a hole in the ground with no one to care for him It was a matter which
might even engage the attention of the Lord God himself
If Samuel craved realism and activity he got it She had him off the place by dawn His hand was
bandaged by eleven and he was in his own chair at his own table by five in the afternoon
sizzling with fever and Tom was boiling a hen to make chicken soup for him
For three days Samuel lay in bed fighting the fever phantoms and putting names to them too
before his great strength broke down the infection and drove it caterwauling away
Samuel looked up at Tom with clear eyes and said Ill have to get up tried it and sat weakly
back chucklingthe sound he made when any force in the world defeated him He had an idea
that even when beaten he could steal a little victory by laughing at defeat And Tom brought him
chicken soup until he wanted to kill him The lore had not died out of the world and you will still
find people who believe that soup will cure any hurt or illness and is no bad thing to have for the
funeral either
Liza stayed away a week She cleaned the Trask house from the top clear down into the grain of
the wooden floors She washed everything she could bend enough to get into a tub and sponged
the rest She put the babies on a working basis and noted with satisfaction that they howled most
of the time and began to gain weight Lee she used like a slave since she didnt uite believe in
him Adam she ignored since she couldnt use him for anything She did make him wash the
windows and then did it again after he had finished
Liza sat with Cathy just enough to come to the conclusion that she was a sensible girl who didnt
talk very much or try to teach her grandmother to suck eggs She also checked her over and found
that she was perfectly healthy not injured and not sick and that she would never nurse the twins
And just as well too she said Those great lummoxes would chew a little thing like you to the
bone She forgot that she was smaller than Cathy and had nursed every one of her own children
On Saturday afternoon Liza checked her work left a list of instructions as long as her arm to
cover every possibility from colic to an inroad of grease ants packed her traveling basket and
had Lee drive her home
She found her house a stable of filth and abomination and she set to cleaning it with the violence
and disgust of a Hercules at labor Samuel asked uestions of her in flight
How were the babies
They were fine growing
How was Adam
Well he moved around as if he was alive but he left no evidence The Lord in his wisdom gave
money to very curious people perhaps because theyd starve without
How was Mrs Trask
uiet lackadaisical like most rich Eastern women Liza had never known a rich Eastern
woman but on the other hand docile and respectful And its a strange thing Liza said I can
find no real fault with her save perhaps a touch of laziness and yet I dont like her very much
Maybe its that scar How did she get it
I dont know said Samuel
Liza leveled her forefinger like a pistol between his eyes Ill tell you something Unbeknownst
to herself shes put a spell on her husband He moons around her like a sick duck I dont think
hes given the twins a thorough good look yet
Samuel waited until she went by again He said Well if shes lazy and hes moony whos
going to take care of the sweet babies Twin boys take a piece of looking after
Liza stopped in midswoop drew a chair close to him and sat resting her hands on her knees
Remember Ive never held the truth lightly if you dont believe me she said
I dont think you could lie dearie he said and she smiled thinking it a compliment
Well what Im to tell you might weigh a little heavy on your belief if you did not know that
Samuel you know that Chinese with his slanty eyes and his outlandish talk and that braid
Lee Sure I know him
Well wouldnt you say offhand he was a heathen
Come now Samuel anybody would But hes not She straightened up
What is he
She tapped his arm with an iron finger A Presbyterian and well upwell up I say when you
dig it out of that crazy talk Now what do you think of that
Samuels voice was unsteady with trying to clamp his laughter in No he said
And I say yes Well now who do you think is looking after the twins I wouldnt trust a heathen
from here to omegabut a Presbyterianhe learned everything I told him
No wonder theyre taking on weight said Samuel
Its a matter for praise and its a matter for prayer
Well do it too said Samuel Both
For a week Cathy rested and gathered her strength On Saturday of the second week of October
she stayed in her bedroom all morning Adam tried the door and found it locked
Im busy she called and he went away
Putting her bureau in order he thought for he could hear her opening drawers and closing them
In the late afternoon Lee came to Adam where he sat on the stoop Missy say I go King City buy
nursey bottle he said uneasily
Well do it then said Adam Shes your mistress
Missy say not come back mebbe Monday Take
Cathy spoke calmly from the doorway He hasnt had a day off for a long time A rest would do
him good
Of course said Adam I just didnt think of it Have a good time If I need anything Ill get
one of the carpenters
Men go home Sunday
Ill get the Indian Lopez will help
Lee felt Cathys eyes on him Lopez dlunk Find bottle whisky
Adam said petulantly Im not helpless Lee Stop arguing
Lee looked at Cathy standing in the doorway He lowered his eyelids Mebbe I come back late
he said and he thought he saw two dark lines appear between her eyes and then disappear He
turned away Gooby he said
Cathy went back to her room as the evening came down At seventhirty Adam knocked Ive
got you some supper dear Its not much The door opened as though she had been standing
waiting She was dressed in her neat traveling dress the jacket edged in black braid black velvet
lapels and large jet buttons On her head was a wide straw hat with a tiny crown long jetbeaded
hatpins held it on Adams mouth dropped open
She gave him no chance to speak Im going away now
Cathy what do you mean
I told you before
You didnt listen It doesnt matter
I dont believe you
Her voice was dead and metallic I dont give a damn what you believe Im going
The babies
Throw them in one of your wells
He cried in panic Cathy youre sick You cant gonot from menot from me
I can do anything to you Any woman can do anything to you Youre a fool
The word got through his haze Without warning his hands reached for her shoulders and he
thrust her backward As she staggered he took the key from the inside of the door slammed the
door shut and locked it
He stood panting his ear close to the panel and a hysterical sickness poisoned him He could
hear her moving uietly about A drawer was opened and the thought leaped in himshes
going to stay And then there was a little click he could not place His ear was almost touching
the door
Her voice came from so near that he jerked his head back He heard richness in her voice Dear
she said softly I didnt know you would take it so Im sorry Adam
His breath burst hoarsely out of his throat His hand trembled trying to turn the key and it fell
out on the floor after he had turned it He pushed the door open She stood three feet away In her
right hand she held his  Colt and the black hole in the barrel pointed at him He took a step
toward her saw that the hammer was back
She shot him The heavy slug struck him in the shoulder and flattened and tore out a piece of his
shoulderblade The flash and roar smothered him and he staggered back and fell to the floor She
moved slowly toward him cautiously as she might toward a wounded animal He stared up into
her eyes which inspected him impersonally She tossed the pistol on the floor beside him and
walked out of the house
He heard her steps on the porch on the crisp dry oak leaves on the path and then he could hear
her no more And the monotonous sound that had been there all along was the cry of the twins
wanting their dinner He had forgotten to feed them
Horace uinn was the new deputy sheriff appointed to look after things around the King City
district He complained that his new job took him away from his ranch too much His wife
complained even more but the truth of the matter was that nothing much had happened in a
criminal way since Horace had been deputy He had seen himself making a name for himself and
running for sheriff The sheriff was an important officer His job was less flighty than that of
district attorney almost as permanent and dignified as superior court judge Horace didnt want to
stay on the ranch all his life and his wife had an urge to live in Salinas where she had relatives
When the rumors repeated by the Indian and the carpenters that Adam Trask had been shot
reached Horace he saddled up right away and left his wife to finish butchering the pig he had
killed that morning
Just north of the big sycamore tree where the Hester road turns off to the left Horace met Julius
Euskadi Julius was trying to decide whether to go uail hunting or to King City and catch the
train to Salinas to shake some of the dust out of his britches The Euskadis were welltodo
handsome people of Basue extraction
Julius said If youd come along with me Id go into Salinas They tell me that right next door to
Jennys two doors from the Long Green theres a new place called Fayes I heard it was pretty
nice run like San Francisco Theyve got a piano player
Horace rested his elbow on his saddle horn and stirred a fly from his horses shoulder with his
rawhide uirt Some other time he said Ive got to look into something
You wouldnt be going to Trasks would you
Thats right Did you hear anything about it
Not to make any sense I heard Mr Trask shot himself in the shoulder with a fortyfour and then
fired everybody on the ranch How do you go about shooting yourself in the shoulder with a forty
four Horace
I dont know Them Easterners are pretty clever I thought Id go up and find out Didnt his
wife just have a baby
Twins I heard said Julius Maybe they shot him
One hold the gun and the other pull the trigger Hear anything else
All mixed up Horace Want some company
Im not going to deputize you Julius Sheriff says the supervisors are raising hell about the
payroll Hornby out in the Alisal deputized his great aunt and kept her in posse three weeks just
before Easter
Youre fooling
No Im not And you get no star
Hell I dont want to be a deputy Just thought Id ride along with you for company Im curious
Me too Glad to have you Julius I can always fling the oath around your neck if theres any
trouble What do you say the new place is called
Fayes Sacramento woman
They do things pretty nice in Sacramento and Horace told how they did things in Sacramento
as they rode along
It was a nice day to be riding As they turned into the Sanchez draw they were cursing the bad
hunting in recent years Three things are never any goodfarming fishing and hunting
compared to other years that is Julius was saying Christ I wish they hadnt killed off all the
grizzly bears In eighteeneighty my grandfather killed one up by Pleyto weighed eighteen
hundred pounds
A silence came on them as they rode in under the oaks a silence they took from the place itself
There was no sound no movement
I wonder if he finished fixing up the old house Horace said
Hell no Rabbit Holman was working on it and he told me Trask called them all in and fired
them Told them not to come back
They say Trask has got a pot of money
I guess hes well fixed all right said Julius Sam Hamilton is sinking four wellsif he didnt
get fired too
How is Mr Hamilton I ought to go up to see him
Hes fine Full of hell as ever
Ill have to go up and pay him a visit said Horace
Lee came out on the stoop to meet them
Horace said Hello Ching Chong Bossy man here
He sick said Lee
Id like to see him
No see He sick
Thats enough of that said Horace Tell him Deputy Sheriff uinn wants to see him
Lee disappeared and in a moment he was back You come he said I take horsy
Adam lay in the fourposter bed where the twins had been born He was propped high with
pillows and a mound of homedevised bandages covered his left breast and shoulder The room
reeked of Halls Cream Salve
Horace said later to his wife And if you ever saw death still breathing there it was
Adams cheeks hugged the bone and pulled the skin of his nose tight and slimy His eyes seemed
to bulge out of his head and to take up the whole upper part of his face and they were shiny with
sickness intense and myopic His bony right hand kneaded a fistful of coverlet
Horace said Howdy Mr Trask Heard you got hurt He paused waiting for an answer He
went on Just thought Id drop around and see how you were doing Howd it happen
A look of transparent eagerness came over Adams face He shifted slightly in the bed
If it hurts to talk you can whisper Horace added helpfully
Only when I breathe deep Adam said softly I was cleaning my gun and it went off
Horace glanced at Julius and then back Adam saw the look and a little color of embarrassment
rose in his cheeks
Happens all the time said Horace Got the gun around
I think Lee put it away
Horace stepped to the door Hey there Ching Chong bring the pistol
In a moment Lee poked the gun buttfirst through the door Horace looked at it swung the
cylinder out poked the cartridges out and smelled the empty brass cylinder of the one empty
shell Theres better shooting cleaning the damn things than pointing them Ill have to make a
report to the county Mr Trask I wont take up much of your time You were cleaning the barrel
maybe with a rod and the gun went off and hit you in the shoulder
Thats right sir Adam said uickly
And cleaning it you hadnt swung out the cylinder
And you were poking the rod in and out with the barrel pointed toward you with the hammer
cocked
Adams breath rasped in a uick intake
Horace went on And it must have blowed the rod right through you and took off your left hand
too Horaces pale sunwashed eyes never left Adams face He said kindly What happened
Mr Trask Tell me what happened
I tell you truly it was an accident sir
Now you wouldnt have me write a report like I just said The sheriff would think I was crazy
What happened
Well Im not very used to guns Maybe it wasnt just like that but I was cleaning it and it went
off
There was a whistle in Horaces nose He had to breathe through his mouth to stop it He moved
slowly up from the foot of the bed nearer to Adams head and staring eyes You came from the
East not very long ago didnt you Mr Trask
Thats right Connecticut
I guess people dont use guns very much there any more
Not much
Little hunting
Some
So youd be more used to a shotgun
Thats right But I never hunted much
I guess you didnt hardly use a pistol at all so you didnt know how to handle it
Thats right Adam said eagerly Hardly anybody there has a pistol
So when you came here you bought that fortyfour because everybody out here has a pistol and
you were going to learn how to use it
Well I thought it might be a good thing to learn
Julius Euskadi stood tensely his face and body receptive listening but uncommunicative
Horace sighed and looked away from Adam His eyes brushed over and past Julius and came
back to his hands He laid the gun on the bureau and carefully lined the brass and lead cartridges
beside it You know he said Ive only been a deputy a little while I thought I was going to
have some fun with it and maybe in a few years run for sheriff I havent got the guts for it It
isnt any fun to me
Adam watched him nervously
I dont think anybodys ever been afraid of me beforemad at me yesbut not afraid Its a
mean thing makes me feel mean
Julius said irritably Get to it You cant resign right this minute
The hell I cantif I want to All right Mr Trask you served in the United States Cavalry The
weapons of the cavalry are carbines and pistols You He stopped and swallowed What
happened Mr Trask
Adams eyes seemed to grow larger and they were moist and edged with red It was an
accident he whispered
Anybody see it Was your wife with you when it happened
Adam did not reply and Horace saw that his eyes were closed Mr Trask he said I know
youre a sick man Im trying to make it as easy on you as I can Why dont you rest now while I
have a talk with your wife He waited a moment and then turned to the doorway where Lee still
stood Ching Chong tell Missy I would admire to talk to her for a few minutes
Lee did not reply
Adam spoke without opening his eyes My wife is away on a visit
She wasnt here when it happened Horace glanced at Julius and saw a curious expression on
Juliuss lips The corners of his mouth were turned slightly up in a sardonic smile Horace
thought uickly Hes ahead of me Hed make a good sheriff Say he said thats kind of
interesting Your wife had a babytwo babiestwo weeks ago and now shes gone on a visit
Did she take the babies with her I thought I heard them a little while ago Horace leaned over
the bed and touched the back of Adams clenched right hand I hate this but I cant stop now
Trask he said loudly I want you to tell me what happened This isnt nosiness This is the law
Now damn it you open your eyes and tell me or by Christ Ill take you in to the sheriff even if
you are hurt
Adam opened his eyes and they were blank like a sleepwalkers eyes And his voice came out
without rise or fall without emphasis and without any emotion It was as though he pronounced
perfectly words in a language he did not understand
My wife went away he said
Where did she go
I dont know where she went
Julius broke in speaking for the first time Why did she go
Horace said angrily You watch it Trask Youre playing pretty close to the edge and I dont like
what Im thinking You must know why she went away
I dont know why she went
Was she sick Did she act strange
Horace turned Ching Chong do you know anything about this
I go King City Satdy Come back mebbe twelve night Find Missy Tlask on floor
So you werent here when it happened
No maam
All right Trask Ill have to get back to you Open up that shade a little Ching Chong so I can
see There thats better Now Im going to do it your way first until I cant any more Your wife
went away Did she shoot you
It was an accident
All right an accident but was the gun in her hand
You dont make it very easy But lets say she went away and we have to find herseelike a
kids game Youre making it that way How long have you been married
Nearly a year
What was her name before you married her
There was a long pause and then Adam said softly I wont tell I promised
Now you watch it Where did she come from
Mr Trask youre talking yourself right into the county jail Lets have a description How tall
was she
Adams eyes gleamed Not talllittle and delicate
Thats just fine What color hair Eyes
She was beautiful
Was
Is
Any scars
Oh God no Yesa scar on her forehead
You dont know her name where she came from where she went and you cant describe her
And you think Im a fool
Adam said She had a secret I promised I wouldnt ask her She was afraid for someone And
without warning Adam began to cry His whole body shook and his breath made little high
sounds It was hopeless crying
Horace felt misery rising in him Come on in the other room Julius he said and led the way
into the living room All right Julius tell me what you think Is he crazy
Did he kill her
Thats what jumped into my mind
Mine too said Horace My God He hurried into the bedroom and came back with the pistol
and the shells I forgot them he apologized I wont last long in this job
Julius asked What are you going to do
Well I think its beyond me I told you I wouldnt put you on the payroll but hold up your right
hand
I dont want to get sworn in Horace I want to go to Salinas
You dont have any choice Julius Ill have to arrest you if you dont get your goddam hand up
Julius reluctantly put up his hand and disgustedly repeated the oath And thats what I get for
keeping you company he said My father will skin me alive All right what do we do now
Horace said Im going to run to papa I need the sheriff Id take Trask in but I dont want to
move him Youve got to stay Julius Im sorry Have you got a gun
Hell no
Well take this one and take my star He unpinned it from his shirt and held it out
How long do you think youll be gone
Not any longer than I can help Did you ever see Mrs Trask Julius
No I didnt
Neither did I And Ive got to tell the sheriff that Trask doesnt know her name or anything And
shes not very big and she is beautiful Thats one hell of a description I think Ill resign before I
tell the sheriff because hes sure as hell going to fire me afterward Do you think he killed her
How the hell do I know
Dont get mad
Julius picked up the gun and put the cartridges back in the cylinder and balanced it in his hand
You want an idea Horace
Dont it look like Ineed one
Well Sam Hamilton knew herhe took the babies Rabbit says And Mrs Hamilton took care
of her Why dont you ride out there on your way and find out what she really looked like
I think maybe you better keep that star said Horace Thats good Ill get going
You want me to look around
I want you just to see that he doesnt get awayor hurt himself Understand Take care of
yourself
About midnight Horace got on a freight train in King City He sat up in the cab with the engineer
and he was in Salinas the first thing in the morning Salinas was the county seat and it was a fast
growing town Its population was due to cross the two thousand mark any time It was the biggest
town between San Jose and San Luis Obispo and everyone felt that a brilliant future was in store
for it
Horace walked up from the Southern Pacific Depot and stopped in the Chop House for breakfast
He didnt want to get the sheriff out so early and rouse ill will when it wasnt necessary In the
Chop House he ran into young Will Hamilton looking pretty prosperous in a saltandpepper
business suit
Horace sat down at the table with him How are you Will
Oh pretty good
Up here on business
Well yes I do have a little deal on
You might let me in on something sometime Horace felt strange talking like this to such a
young man but Will Hamilton had an aura of success about him Everybody knew he was going
to be a very influential man in the county Some people exude their futures good or bad
Ill do that Horace I thought the ranch took all your time
I could be persuaded to rent it if anything turned up
Will leaned over the table You know Horace our part of the county has been pretty much left
out Did you ever think of running for office
Well youre a deputydid you ever think of running for sheriff
Why no I didnt
Well you think about it Just keep it under your hat Ill look you up in a couple of weeks and
well talk about it But keep it under your hat
Ill certainly do that Will But weve got an awful good sheriff
I know Thats got nothing to do with it King City hasnt got a single county officeryou see
I see Ill think about it Oh by the way I stopped by and saw your father and mother yesterday
Wills face lighted up You did How were they
Just fine You know your father is a real comical genius
Will chuckled He made us laugh all the time we were growing up
But hes a smart man too Will He showed me a new kind of windmill hes invented
goddamnedest thing you ever saw
Oh Lord said Will here come the patent attorneys again
But this is good said Horace
Theyre all good And the only people who make any money are the patent lawyers Drives my
mother crazy
I guess youve got a point there
Will said The only way to make any money is to sell something somebody else makes
Youve got a point there Will but this is the goddamnedest windmill you ever saw
He took you in did he Horace
I guess he did But you wouldnt want him to change would you
Oh Lord no said Will You think about what I said
All right
And keep it under your hat said Will
The sheriffs job was not an easy one and that county which out of the grab bag of popular
elections pulled a good sheriff was lucky It was a complicated position The obvious duties of
the sheriffenforcing the law and keeping the peacewere far from the most important ones It
was true that the sheriff represented armed force in the county but in a community seething with
individuals a harsh or stupid sheriff did not last long There were water rights boundary disputes
astray arguments domestic relations paternity mattersall to be settled without force of arms
Only when everything else failed did a good sheriff make an arrest The best sheriff was not the
best fighter but the best diplomat And Monterey County had a good one He had a brilliant gift
for minding his own business
Horace went into the sheriffs office in the old county jail about ten minutes after nine The
sheriff shook hands and discussed the weather and the crops until Horace was ready to get down
to business
Well sir Horace said finally I had to come up to get your advice And he told his story in
great detailwhat everybody had said and how they looked and what time it waseverything
After a few moments the sheriff closed his eyes and laced his fingers together He punctuated the
account occasionally by opening his eyes but he made no comment
Well there I was on a limb Horace said I couldnt find out what happened I couldnt even
find out what the woman looked like It was Julius Euskadi got the idea I should go to see Sam
Hamilton
The sheriff stirred crossed his legs and inspected the job You think he killed her
Well I did But Mr Hamilton kind of talked me out of it He says Trask hasnt got it in him to
kill anybody
Everybodys got it in him the sheriff said You just find his trigger and anybody will go off
Mr Hamilton told me some funny things about her You know when he was taking her babies
she bit him on the hand You ought to see that hand like a wolf got him
Did Sam give you a description
He did and his wife did Horace took a piece of paper from his pocket and read a detailed
description of Cathy Between the two of them the Hamiltons knew pretty much everything
physical there was to know about Cathy
When Horace finished the sheriff sighed They both agreed about the scar
Yes they did And both of them remarked about how sometimes it was darker than other times
The sheriff closed his eyes again and leaned back in his chair Suddenly he straightened up
opened a drawer of his rolltop desk and took out a pint of whisky Have a drink he said
Dont mind if I do Heres looking at you Horace wiped his mouth and handed back the pint
Got any ideas he asked
The sheriff took three big swallows of whisky corked the pint and put it back in the drawer
before he replied Weve got a pretty wellrun county he said I get along with the constables
give them a hand when they need it and they help me out when I need it You take a town
growing like Salinas and strangers in and out all the timewe could have trouble if we didnt
watch it pretty close My office gets along fine with the local people He looked Horace in the
eye Dont get restless Im not making a speech I just want to tell you how it is We dont drive
people Weve got to live with them
Did I do something wrong
No you didnt Horace You did just right If you hadnt come to town or if you had brought Mr
Trask in wed of been in one hell of a mess Now hold on Im going to tell you
Im listening said Horace
Over across the tracks down by Chinatown theres a row of whorehouses
I know that
Everybody knows it If we closed them up theyd just move The people want those houses We
keep an eye on them so not much bad happens And the people that run those houses keep in
touch with us Ive picked up some wanted men from tips I got down there
Horace said Julius told me
Now wait a minute Let me get all this said so we wont have to go back over it About three
months ago a finelooking woman came in to see me She wanted to open a house here and
wanted to do it right Came from Sacramento Ran a place there She had letters from some pretty
important peoplestraight recordnever had any trouble A pretty damn good citizen
Julius told me Name of Faye
Thats right Well she opened a nice place uiet well run It was about time old Jenny and the
Nigger had some competition They were mad as hell about it but I told them just what I told
you Its about time they had some competition
Theres a piano player
Yes there is Good one tooblind fella Say are you going to let me tell this
Im sorry said Horace
Thats all right I know Im slow but Im thorough Anyways Faye turned out to be just what
she looks like a good solid citizen Now theres one thing a good uiet whorehouse is more
scared of than anything else Take a flighty randy girl runs off from home and goes in a house
Her old man finds her and he begins to shovel up hell Then the churches get into it and the
women and pretty soon that whorehouse has got a bad name and weve got to close it up You
understand
Yeah Horace said softly
Now dont get ahead of me I hate to tell something you already thought out Faye sent me a
note Sunday night Shes got a girl and she cant make much out of her What puzzles Faye is that
this kid looks like a runaway girl except shes a goddam good whore She knows all the answers
and all the tricks I went down and looked her over She told me the usual bull but I cant find a
thing wrong with her Shes of age and nobodys made a complaint He spread his hands Well
there it is What do we do about it
Youre pretty sure its Mrs Trask
The sheriff said Wideset eyes yellow hair and a scar on her forehead and she came in Sunday
afternoon
Adams weeping face was in Horaces mind God all mighty Sheriff you got to get somebody
else to tell him Ill uit before I do
The sheriff gazed into space You say he didnt even know her name where she came from She
really bullshitted him didnt she
The poor bastard Horace said The poor bastard is in love with her No by God somebody
else has got to tell him I wont
The sheriff stood up Lets go down to the Chop House and get a cup of coffee
They walked along the street in silence for a while Horace the sheriff said if I told some of
the things I know this whole goddam county would go up in smoke
I guess thats right
You said she had twins
Yeah twin boys
You listen to me Horace Theres only three people in the world that knowsher and you and
me Im going to warn her that if she ever tells Ill brush her ass out of this county so fast itll
burn And Horaceif you should ever get an itchy tongue before you tell anybody even your
wife why you think about those little boys finding out their mother is a whore
Adam sat in his chair under the big oak tree His left arm was expertly bandaged against his side
so that he could not move his shoulder Lee came out carrying the laundry basket He set it on the
ground beside Adam and went back inside
The twins were awake and they both looked blindly and earnestly up at the windmoved leaves
of the oak tree A dry oak leaf came whirling down and landed in the basket Adam leaned over
and picked it out
He didnt hear Samuels horse until it was almost upon him but Lee had seen him coming He
brought a chair out and led Doxology away toward the shed
Samuel sat down uietly and he didnt trouble Adam by looking at him too much and he didnt
trouble him by not looking at him The wind freshened in the treetops and a fringe of it ruffled
Samuels hair I thought Id better get back to the wells Samuel said softly
Adams voice had gone rusty from lack of use No he said I dont want any wells Ill pay for
the work you did
Samuel leaned over the basket and put his finger against the small palm of one of the twins and
the fingers closed and held on I guess the last bad habit a man will give up is advising
I dont want advice
Nobody does Its a givers present Go through the motions Adam
What motions
Act out being alive like a play And after a while a long while it will be true
Why should I Adam asked
Samuel was looking at the twins Youre going to pass something down no matter what you do
or if you do nothing Even if you let yourself go fallow the weeds will grow and the brambles
Something will grow
Adam did not answer and Samuel stood up Ill be back he said Ill be back again and again
Go through the motions Adam
In the back of the shed Lee held Doxology while Sam mounted There goes your bookstore
Lee he said
Oh well said the Chinese maybe I didnt want it much anyway
A new country seems to follow a pattern First come the openers strong and brave and rather
childlike They can take care of themselves in a wilderness but they are naïve and helpless
against men and perhaps that is why they went out in the first place When the rough edges are
worn off the new land businessmen and lawyers come in to help with the developmentto solve
problems of ownership usually by removing the temptations to themselves And finally comes
culture which is entertainment relaxation transport out of the pain of living And culture can be
on any level and is
The church and the whorehouse arrived in the Far West simultaneously And each would have
been horrified to think it was a different facet of the same thing But surely they were both
intended to accomplish the same thing the singing the devotion the poetry of the churches took
a man out of his bleakness for a time and so did the brothels The sectarian churches came in
swinging cocky and loud and confident Ignoring the laws of debt and repayment they built
churches which couldnt be paid for in a hundred years The sects fought evil true enough but
they also fought each other with a fine lustiness They fought at the turn of a doctrine Each
happily believed all the others were bound for hell in a basket And each for all its bump
tiousness brought with it the same thing the Scripture on which our ethics our art and poetry
and our relationships are built It took a smart man to know where the difference lay between the
sects but anyone could see what they had in common And they brought musicmaybe not the
best but the form and sense of it And they brought conscience or rather nudged the dozing
conscience They were not pure but they had a potential of purity like a soiled white shirt And
any man could make something pretty fine of it within himself True enough the Reverend
Billing when they caught up with him turned out to be a thief an adulterer a libertine and a
zoophilist but that didnt change the fact that he had communicated some good things to a great
number of receptive people Billing went to jail but no one ever arrested the good things he had
released And it doesnt matter much that his motive was impure He used good material and
some of it stuck I use Billing only as an outrageous example The honest preachers had energy
and go They fought the devil no holds barred boots and eyegouging permitted You might get
the idea that they howled truth and beauty the way a seal bites out the National Anthem on a row
of circus horns But some of the truth and beauty remained and the anthem was recognizable
The sects did more than this though They built the structure of social life in the Salinas Valley
The church supper is the grandfather of the country club just as the Thursday poetry reading in
the basement under the vestry sired the little theater
While the churches bringing the sweet smell of piety for the soul came in prancing and farting
like brewery horses in bockbeer time the sister evangelism with release and joy for the body
crept in silently and gravely with its head bowed and its face covered
You may have seen the spangled palaces of sin and fancy dancing in the false West of the
movies and maybe some of them existedbut not in the Salinas Valley The brothels were uiet
orderly and circumspect Indeed if after hearing the ecstatic shrieks of climactic conversion
against the thumping beat of the melodeon you had stood under the window of a whorehouse
and listened to the low decorous voices you would have been likely to confuse the identities of
the two ministries The brothel was accepted while it was not admitted
I will tell you about the solemn courts of love in Salinas They were about the same in other
towns but the Salinas Row has a pertinence to this telling
You walked west on Main Street until it bent Thats where Castroville Street crossed Main
Castroville Street is now called Market Street God knows why Streets used to be named for the
place they aimed at Thus Castroville Street if you followed it nine miles brought you to
Castroville Alisal Street to Alisal and so forth
Anyway when you came to Castroville Street you turned right Two blocks down the Southern
Pacific tracks cut diagonally across the street on their way south and a street crossed Castroville
Street from east to west And for the life of me I cannot remember the name of that street If you
turned left on that street and crossed the tracks you were in Chinatown If you turned right you
were on the Row
It was a black dobe street deep shining mud in winter and hard as rutted iron in summer In the
spring the tall grass grew along its sideswild oats and mallow weeds and yellow mustard
mixed in In the early morning the sparrows shrieked over the horse manure in the street
Do you remember hearing that old men And do you remember how an easterly breeze brought
odors in from Chinatown roasting pork and punk and black tobacco and yen shi And do you
remember the deep Waiting stroke of the great gong in the Joss House and how its tone hung in
the air so long
Remember too the little houses unpainted unrepaired They seemed very small and they tried
to efface themselves in outside neglect and the wild overgrown front yards tried to hide them
from the street Remember how the shades were always drawn with little lines of yellow light
around their edges You could hear only a murmur from within Then the front door would open
to admit a country boy and youd hear laughter and perhaps the soft sentimental tone of an open
face piano with a piece of toilet chain across the strings and then the door would close it off
Then you might hear horses hoofs on the dirt street and Pet Bulene would drive his hack up in
front and maybe four or five portly men would get outgreat men rich or official bankers
maybe or the courthouse gang And Pet would drive around the corner and settle down in his
hack to wait for them Big cats would ripple across the street to disappear in the tall grass
And thenrememberthe train whistle and the boring light and a freight from King City
would go stomping across Castroville Street and into Salinas and you could hear it sighing at the
station Remember
Every town has its celebrated madams eternal women to be sentimentalized down the years
There is something very attractive to men about a madam She combines the brains of a
businessman the toughness of a prize fighter the warmth of a companion the humor of a
tragedian Myths collect around her and oddly enough not voluptuous myths The stories
remembered and repeated about a madam cover every field but the bedroom Remembering her
old customers picture her as a philanthropist medical authority bouncer and poetess of the
bodily emotions without being involved with them
For a number of years Salinas had sheltered two of these treasures Jenny sometimes called
Fartin Jenny and the Nigger who owned and operated the Long Green Jenny was a good
companion a keeper of secrets a giver of secret loans There is a whole literature of stories
about Jenny in Salinas
The Nigger was a handsome austere woman with snowwhite hair and a dark and awful dignity
Her brown eyes brooding deep in her skull looked out on an ugly world with philosophic
sorrow She conducted her house like a cathedral dedicated to a sad but erect Priapus If you
wanted a good laugh and a poke in the ribs you went to Jennys and got your moneys worth but
if the sweet worldsadness close to tears crept out of your immutable loneliness the Long Green
was your place When you came out of there you felt that something pretty stern and important
had happened It was no jump in the hay The dark beautiful eyes of the Nigger stayed with you
for days
When Faye came down from Sacramento and opened her house there was a flurry of animosity
from the two incumbents They got together to drive Faye out but they discovered she was not in
competition
Faye was the motherly type bigbreasted bighipped and warm She was a bosom to cry on a
soother and a stroker The iron sex of the Nigger and the tavern bacchanalianism of Jenny had
their devotees and they were not lost to Faye Her house became the refuge of young men
puling in puberty mourning over lost virtue and aching to lose some more Faye was the
reassurer of misbegotten husbands Her house took up the slack for frigid wives It was the
cinnamonscented kitchen of ones grandmother If any sexual thing happened to you at Fayes
you felt it was an accident but forgivable Her house led the youths of Salinas into the thorny path
of sex in the pinkest smoothest way Faye was a nice woman not very bright highly moral and
easily shocked People trusted her and she trusted everyone No one could want to hurt Faye once
he knew her She was no competition to the others She was a third phase
Just as in a store or on a ranch the employees are images of the boss so in a whorehouse the girls
are very like the madam partly because she hires that kind and partly because a good madam
imprints her personality on the business You could stay a very long time at Fayes before you
would hear an ugly or suggestive word spoken The wanderings to the bedrooms the payments
were so soft and casual they seemed incidental All in all she ran a hell of a fine house as the
constable and the sheriff knew Faye contributed heavily to every charity Having a revulsion
against disease she paid for regular inspection of her girls You had less chance of contracting a
difficulty at Fayes than with your Sunday School teacher Faye soon became a solid and
desirable citizen of the growing town of Salinas
The girl Kate puzzled Fayeshe was so young and pretty so ladylike so well educated Faye
took her into her own inviolate bedroom and uestioned her far more than she would if Kate had
been another kind of girl There were always women knocking on the door of a whorehouse and
Faye recognized most of them instantly She could tick them offlazy vengeful lustful
unsatisfied greedy ambitious Kate didnt fall into any of these classes
I hope you dont mind my asking you all these uestions she said It just seems so strange
that you should come here Why you could get a husband and a surrey and a corner house in
town with no trouble at all no trouble at all And Faye rolled her wedding band around and
around on her fat little finger
Kate smiled shyly Its so hard to explain I hope you wont insist on knowing The happiness of
someone very near and dear to me is involved Please dont ask me
Faye nodded solemnly Ive known things like that I had one girl who was supporting her baby
and no one knew for a long long time That girl has a fine house and a husband inthere I
nearly told you where Id cut out my tongue before Id tell Do you have a baby dear
Kate looked down to try to conceal the shine of tears in her eyes When she could control her
throat she whispered Im sorry I cant talk about it
Thats all right Thats all right You just take your time
Faye was not bright but she was far from stupid She went to the sheriff and got herself cleared
There was no sense in taking chances She knew something was wrong about Kate but if it didnt
harm the house it really wasnt Fayes business
Kate might have been a chiseler but she wasnt She went to work right away And when
customers come back again and again and ask for a girl by name you know youve got
something A pretty face wont do that It was uite apparent to Faye that Kate was not learning a
new trade
There are two things it is good to know about a new girl first will she work and second will
she get along with the other girls Theres nothing will upset a house like an illtempered girl
Faye didnt have long to wonder about the second uestion Kate put herself out to be pleasant
She helped the other girls keep their rooms clean She served them when they were sick listened
to their troubles answered them in matters of love and as soon as she had some loaned them
money You couldnt want a better girl She became best friend to everyone in the house
There was no trouble Kate would not take no drudgery she was afraid of and in addition she
brought business She soon had her own group of regular customers Kate was thoughtful too
She remembered birthdays and always had a present and a cake with candles Faye realized she
had a treasure
People who dont know think it is easy to be a madamjust sit in a big chair and drink beer and
take half the money the girls make they think But its not like that at all You have to feed the
girlsthats groceries and a cook Your laundry problem is uite a bit more complicated than
that of a hotel You have to keep the girls well and as happy as possible and some of them can
get pretty ornery You have to keep suicide at an absolute minimum and whores particularly the
ones getting along in years are flighty with a razor and that gets your house a bad name
It isnt so easy and if you have waste too you can lose money When Kate offered to help with
the marketing and planning of meals Faye was pleased although she didnt know when the girl
found time Well not only did the food improve but the grocery bills came down onethird the
first month Kate took over And the laundryFaye didnt know what Kate said to the man but
that bill suddenly dropped twentyfive per cent Faye didnt see how she ever got along without
Kate
In the late afternoon before business they sat together in Fayes room and drank tea It was much
nicer since Kate had painted the woodwork and put up lace curtains The girls began to realize
that there were two bosses not one and they were glad because Kate was very easy to get along
with She made them turn more tricks but she wasnt mean about it Theyd as likely as not have
a big laugh over it
By the time a year had passed Faye and Kate were like mother and daughter And the girls said
You watchshell own this house some day
Kates hands were always busy mostly at drawn worn on the sheerest of lawn handkerchiefs She
could make beautiful initials Nearly all the girls carried and treasured her handkerchiefs
Gradually a perfectly natural thing happened Faye the essence of motherness began to think of
Kate as her daughter She felt this in her breast and in her emotions and her natural morality took
hold She did not want her daughter to be a whore It was a perfectly reasonable seuence
Faye thought hard how she was going to bring up the subject It was a problem It was Fayes
nature to approach any subject sideways She could not say I want you to give up whoring
She said If it is a secret dont answer but Ive always meant to ask you What did the sheriff
say to yougood Lord is it a year ago How the time goes uicker as you get older I think He
was nearly an hour with you He didntbut of course not Hes a family man He goes to
Jennys But I dont want to pry into your affairs
Theres no secret at all about that said Kate I would have told you He told me I should go
home He was very nice about it When I explained that I couldnt he was very nice and
understanding
Did you tell him why Faye asked jealously
Of course not Do you think I would tell him when I wont tell you Dont be silly darling
Youre such a funny little girl
Faye smiled and snuggled contentedly down in her chair
Kates face was in repose but she was remembering every word of that interview As a matter of
fact she rather liked the sheriff He was direct
He had closed the door of her room glanced around with the uick recording eye of a good
policemanno photographs none of the personal articles which identify nothing but clothes
and shoes
He sat down on her little cane rocking chair and his buttocks hung over on each side His fingers
got together in conference talking to one another like ants He spoke in an unemotional tone
almost as though he werent much interested in what he was saying Maybe that was what
impressed her
At first she put on her slightly stupid demure look but after a few of his words she gave that up
and bored into him with her eyes trying to read his thoughts He neither looked in her eyes nor
avoided them But she was aware that he was inspecting her as she inspected him She felt his
glance go over the scar on her forehead almost as though he had touched it
I dont want to make a record he said uietly Ive held office a long time About one more
term will be enough You know young woman if this were fifteen years back Id do some
checking and I guess Id find something pretty nasty He waited for some reaction from her but
she did not protest He nodded his head slowly I dont want to know he said I want peace in
this county and I mean all kinds of peace and that means people getting to sleep at night Now I
havent met your husband he said and she knew he noticed the slight movement of her
tightening muscles I hear hes a very nice man I hear also that hes pretty hard hit He looked
into her eyes for a moment Dont you want to know how bad you shot him
Yes she said
Well hes going to get wellsmashed his shoulder but hes going to get well That Chink is
taking pretty good care of him Course I dont think hell lift anything with his left arm for uite
a spell A fortyfour tears hell out of a man If the Chink hadnt come back hed of bled to death
and youd be staying with me in the jail
Kate was holding her breath listening for any hint of what was coming and not hearing any hints
Im sorry she said uietly
The sheriffs eyes became alert Now thats the first time youve made a mistake he said
Youre not sorry I knew somebody like you oncehung him twelve years ago in front of the
county jail We used to do that here
The little room with its dark mahogany bed its marbletop wash stand with bowl and pitcher and
a door for the pot its wallpaper endlessly repeating little roseslittle rosesthe little room was
silent the sound sucked out of it
The sheriff was staring at a picture of three cherubimjust heads curlyhaired limpideyed
with wings about the size of pigeons wings growing out of where their necks would be He
frowned Thats a funny picture for a whorehouse he said
It was here said Kate Apparently the preliminaries were over now
The sheriff straightened up undid his fingers and held the arms of his chair Even his buttocks
pulled in a little You left a couple of babies he said Little boys Now you calm down Im
not going to try to get you to go back I guess Id do uite a bit to keep you from going back I
think I know you I could just run you over the county line and have the next sheriff run you and
that could keep up till you landed splash in the Atlantic Ocean But I dont want to do that I
dont care how you live as long as you dont give me any trouble A whore is a whore
Kate asked evenly What is it you do want
Thats more like it the sheriff said Heres what I want I notice you changed your name I
want you to keep your new name I guess you made up someplace you came fromwell thats
where you came from And your reasonthats when youre maybe drunkyou keep your
reason about two thousand miles away from King City
She was smiling a little and not a forced smile She was beginning to trust this man and to like
One thing I thought of he said Did you know many people around King City
I heard about the knitting needle he said casually Well it could happen that somebody you
knew might come in here That your real hair color
Dye it black for a while Lots of people look like somebody else
How about this She touched her scar with a slender finger
Well thats just awhat is that word What is that goddam word I had it this morning
Coincidence
Thats itcoincidence He seemed to be finished He got out tobacco and papers and rolled a
clumsy lumpy cigarette He broke out a sulphur match and struck it on the block and held it
away until its acrid blue flame turned yellow His cigarette burned crookedly up the side
Kate said Isnt there a threat I mean what youll do if I
No there isnt I guess I could think up something pretty ornery though if it came to that No I
dont want youwhat you are what you do or what you sayto hurt Mr Trask or his boys
You figure you died and now youre somebody else and well get along fine
He stood up and went to the door then turned Ive got a boyhell be twenty this year big
nicelooking fellow with a broken nose Everybody likes him I dont want him in here Ill tell
Faye too Let him go to Jennys If he comes in you tell him to go to Jennys He closed the
door behind him
Kate smiled down at her fingers
Faye twisted around in her chair to reach a piece of brown panocha studded with walnuts When
she spoke it was around a mouth full of candy Kate wondered uneasily whether she could read
minds for Faye said I still dont like it as well I said it then and I say it again I liked your hair
blond better I dont know what got into you to change it Youve got a fair complexion
Kate caught a single thread of hair with fingernails of thumb and forefinger and gently drew it
out She was very clever She told the best lie of allthe truth I didnt want to tell you she
said I was afraid I might be recognized and that would hurt someone
Faye got up out of her chair and went to Kate and kissed her What a good child it is she said
What a thoughtful dear
Kate said Lets have some tea Ill bring it in She went out of the room and in the hall on the
way to the kitchen she rubbed the kiss from her cheek with her fingertips
Back in her chair Faye picked out a piece of panocha with a whole walnut showing through She
put it in her mouth and bit into a piece of walnut shell The sharp pointed fragment hit a hollow
tooth and whanged into the nerve Blue lights of pain flashed through her Her forehead became
wet When Kate came back with teapot and cups on a tray Faye was clawing at her mouth with a
crooked finger and whimpering in agony
What is it Kate cried
Toothnutshell
Here let me see Open and point Kate looked into the open mouth then went to the nut bowl
on the fringed table for a nut pick In a fraction of a second she had dug out the shell and held it
in the palm of her hand There it is
The nerve stopped shrieking and the pain dropped to an ache Only that big It felt like a house
Look dear said Faye open that second drawer where my medicine is Bring the paregoric and
a piece of cotton Will you help me pack this tooth
Kate brought the bottle and pushed a little ball of saturated cotton into the tooth with the point of
the nut pick You ought to have it out
I know I will
I have three teeth missing on this side
Well youd never know it That made me feel all shaky Bring me the Pinkham will you She
poured herself a slug of the vegetable compound and sighed with relief Thats a wonderful
medicine she said The woman who invented it was a saint
It was a pleasant afternoon Fremonts Peak was lighted pinkly by the setting sun and Faye
could see it from her window From over on Castroville Street came the sweet sound of jingling
horse bells from an eighthorse grain team down from the ridge The cook was fighting pots in
the kitchen There was a rubbing sound on the wall and then a gentle tap on the door
Come in Cotton Eye Faye called
The door opened and the crooked little cottoneyed piano player stood in the entrance waiting for
a sound to tell him where she was
What is it you want Faye asked
He turned to her I dont feel good Miss Faye I want to crawl into my bed and not do no
playing tonight
You were sick two nights last week Cotton Eye Dont you like your job
I dont feel good
Well all right But I wish youd take better care of yourself
Kate said softly Let the gong alone for a couple of weeks Cotton Eye
Oh Miss Kate I didnt know you was here I aint been smoking
Youve been smoking Kate said
Yes Miss Kate I sure will let it alone I dont feel good He closed the door and they could
hear his hand rubbing along the wall to guide him
Faye said He told me hed stopped
He hasnt stopped
The poor thing said Faye he doesnt have much to live for
Kate stood in front of her Youre so sweet she said You believe in everybody Someday if
you dont watch or I dont watch for you someone will steal the roof
Whod want to steal from me asked Faye
Kate put her hand on Fayes plump shoulders Not everyone is as nice as you are
Fayes eyes glistened with tears She picked up a handkerchief from the chair beside her and
wiped her eyes and patted delicately at her nostrils Youre like my own daughter Kate she
Im beginning to believe I am I never knew my mother She died when I was small
Faye drew a deep breath and plunged into the subject
Kate I dont like you working here
Faye shook her head trying to find words Im not ashamed I run a nice house If I didnt
somebody else might run a bad house I dont do anybody any harm Im not ashamed
Why should you be asked Kate
But I dont like you working I just dont like it Youre sort of my daughter I dont like my
daughter working
Dont be a silly darling said Kate I have tohere or somewhere else I told you I have to
have the money
No you dont
Of course I do Where else could I get it
You could be my daughter You could manage the house You could take care of things for me
and not go upstairs Im not always well you know
I know youre not poor darling But I have to have money
Theres plenty for both of us Kate I could give you as much as you make and more and youd
be worth it
Kate shook her head sadly I do love you she said And I wish I could do what you want But
you need your little reserve and Iwell suppose something should happen to you No I must
go on working Do you know dear I have five regulars tonight
A jar of shock struck Faye I dont want you to work
I have to Mother
The word did it Faye burst into tears and Kate sat on the arm of her chair and stroked her cheek
and wiped her streaming eyes The outburst sniffled to a close
The dusk was settling deeply on the valley Kates face was a glow of lightness under her dark
hair Now youre all right Ill go and look in on the kitchen and then dress
Kate cant you tell your regulars youre sick
Of course not Mother
Kate its Wednesday Probably wont be anybody in after one oclock
The Woodmen of the World are having a do
Oh yes But on Wednesdaythe Woodmen wont be here after two
What are you getting at
Kate when you close you tap on my door Ill have a little surprise for you
What kind of a surprise
Oh a secret surprise Will you ask the cook to come in as you go by the kitchen
Sounds like a cake surprise
Now dont ask uestions darling Its a surprise
Kate kissed her What a dear you are Mother
When she had closed the door behind her Kate stood for a moment in the hall Her fingers
caressed her little pointed chin Her eyes were calm Then she stretched her arms over her head
and strained her body in a luxurious yawn She ran her hands slowly down her sides from right
under her breasts to her hips Her mouth corners turned up a little and she moved toward the
kitchen
The few regulars drifted in and out and two drummers walked down the Line to look them over
but not a single Woodman of the World showed up The girls sat yawning in the parlor until two
oclock waiting
What kept the Woodmen away was a sad accident Clarence Monteith had a heart attack right in
the middle of the closing ritual and before supper They laid him out on the carpet and dampened
his forehead until the doctor came Nobody felt like sitting down to the doughnut supper After
Dr Wilde had arrived and looked Clarence over the Woodmen made a stretcher by putting
flagpoles through the sleeves of two overcoats On the way home Clarence died and they had to
go for Dr Wilde again And by the time they had made plans for the funeral and written the piece
for the Salinas Journal nobody had any heart for a whorehouse
The next day when they found out what had happened the girls all remembered what Ethel had
said at ten minutes to two
My God Ethel had said I never heard it so uiet No music cats got Kates tongue Its like
setting up with a corpse
Later Ethel was impressed with having said italmost as if she knew
Grace had said I wonder what cats got Kates tongue Dont you feel good KateI said dont
you feel good
Kate started Oh I guess I was thinking of something
Well Im not said Grace Im sleepy Why dont we close up Lets ask Faye if we cant lock
up There wont even be a Chink in tonight Im going to ask Faye
Kates voice cut in on her Let Faye alone Shes not well Well close up at two
That clocks way wrong said Ethel Whats the matter with Faye
Kate said Maybe thats what I was thinking about Fayes not well Im worried to death about
her She wont show it if she can help it
I thought she was all right Grace said
Ethel hit the jackpot again Well she dont look good to me Shes got a kind of flush I noticed
it
Kate spoke very softly Dont you girls ever let her know I told you She wouldnt want you to
worry What a dear she is
Best goddam house I ever hustled said Grace
Alice said You better not let her hear you talk words like that
Balls said Grace She knows all the words
She dont like to hear themnot from us
Kate said patiently I want to tell you what happened I was having tea with her late this
afternoon and she fainted dead away I do wish shed see a doctor
I noticed she had a kind of bright flush Ethel repeated That clocks way wrong but I forget
which way
Kate said You girls go on to bed Ill lock up
When they were gone Kate went to her room and put on her pretty new print dress that made her
look like a little girl She brushed and braided her hair and let it hang behind in one thick pigtail
tied with a little white bow She patted her cheeks with Florida water For a moment she
hesitated and then from the top bureau drawer she took a little gold watch that hung from a fleur
delis pin She wrapped it in one of her fine lawn handkerchiefs and went out of the room
The hall was very dark but a rim of light showed under Fayes door Kate tapped softly
Faye called Who is it
Its Kate
Dont you come in yet You wait outside Ill tell you when Kate heard a rustling and a
scratching in the room Then Faye called All right Come in
The room was decorated Japanese lanterns with candles in them hung on bamboo sticks at the
corners and red crepe paper twisted in scallops from the center to the corners to give the effect of
a tent On the table with candlesticks around it was a big white cake and a box of chocolates
and beside these a basket with a magnum of champagne peeking out of crushed ice Faye wore
her best lace dress and her eyes were shiny with emotion
What in the world Kate cried She closed the door Why it looks like a party
It is a party Its a party for my dear daughter
Its not my birthday Faye said In a way maybe it is
I dont know what you mean But I brought you a present She laid the folded handkerchief in
Fayes lap Open it carefully she said
Faye held the watch up Oh my dear my dear You crazy child No I cant take it She opened
the face and then picked open the back with her fingernail It was engravedTo C with all my
heart from A
It was my mothers watch Kate said softly I would like my new mother to have it
My darling child My darling child
Mother would be glad
But its my party I have a present for my dear daughterbut Ill have to do it in my own way
Now Kate you open the bottle of wine and pour two glasses while I cut the cake I want it to be
fancy
When everything was ready Faye took her seat behind the table She raised her glass To my
new daughtermay you have long life and happiness And when they had drunk Kate proposed
To my mother Faye said Youll make me crydont make me cry Over on the bureau dear
Bring the little mahogany box There thats the one Now put it on the table here and open it
In the polished box lay a rolled white paper tied with a red ribbon What in the world is it Kate
asked Its my gift to you Open it
Kate very carefully untied the red ribbon and unrolled the tube It was written elegantly with
shaded letters and it was well and carefully drawn and witnessed by the cook
All my worldly goods without exception to Kate Albey because I regard her as my daughter
It was simple direct and legally irreproachable Kate read it three times looked back at the date
studied the cooks signature Faye watched her and her lips were parted in expectation When
Kates lips moved reading Fayes lips moved
Kate rolled the paper and tied the ribbon around it and put it in the box and closed the lid She sat
in her chair
Faye said at last Are you pleased
Kates eyes seemed to peer into and beyond Fayes eyesto penetrate the brain behind the eyes
Kate said uietly Im trying to hold on Mother I didnt know anyone could be so good Im
afraid if I say anything too uickly or come too close to you Ill break to pieces
It was more dramatic than Faye had anticipated uiet and electric Faye said Its a funny
present isnt it
Funny No it isnt funny
I mean a will is a strange present But it means more than that Now you are my real daughter I
can tell you Ino wehave cash and securities in excess of sixty thousand dollars In my desk
are notations of accounts and safedeposit boxes I sold the place in Sacramento for a very good
price Why are you so silent child Is something bothering you
A will sounds like death Thats thrown a pall
But everyone should make a will
I know Mother Kate smiled ruefully A thought crossed my mind I thought of all your kin
coming in angrily to break such a will as this You cant do this
My poor little girl is that whats bothering you I have no folks As far as I know I have no kin
And if I did have somewho would know Do you think you are the only one with secrets Do
you think I use the name I was born with
Kate looked long and levelly at Faye
Kate she cried Kate its a party Dont be sad Dont be frozen
Kate got up gently pulled the table aside and sat down on the floor She put her cheek on Fayes
knee Her slender fingers traced a gold thread on the skirt through its intricate leaf pattern And
Faye stroked Kates cheek and hair and touched her strange ears Shyly Fayes fingers explored
to the borders of the scar
I think Ive never been so happy before said Kate
My darling You make me happy too Happier than I have ever been Now I dont feel alone
Now I feel safe
Kate picked delicately at the gold thread with her fingernails
They sat in the warmth for a long time before Faye stirred Kate she said were forgetting
Its a party Weve forgotten the wine Pour it child Well have a little celebration
Kate said uneasily Do we need it Mother
Its good Why not I like to take on a little load It lets the poison out Dont you like
champagne Kate
Well I never have drunk much its not good for me
Nonsense Pour it darling
Kate got up from the floor and filled the glasses
Faye said Now drink it down Im watching you Youre not going to let an old woman get silly
by herself
Youre not an old woman Mother
Dont talkdrink it I wont touch mine until yours is empty She held her glass until Kate had
emptied hers then gulped it Good thats good she said Fill them up Now come on dear
down the rat hole After two or three the bad things go away
Kates chemistry screamed against the wine She remembered and she was afraid
Faye said Now let me see the bottom childthere You see how good it is Fill up again
The transition came to Kate almost immediately after the second glass Her fear evaporated her
fear of anything disappeared This was what she had been afraid of and now it was too late The
wine had forced a passage through all the carefully built barriers and defenses and deceptions
and she didnt care The thing she had learned to cover and control was lost Her voice became
chill and her mouth was thin Her wideset eyes slitted and grew watchful and sardonic
Now you drinkMotherwhile I watch she said Theres adear Ill bet you cant drink
two without stopping
Dont bet me Kate Youd lose I can drink six without stopping
Let me see you
If I do will you
The contest started and a puddle of wine spread out over the tabletop and the wine went down in
the magnum
Faye giggled When I was a girlI could tell you stories maybe you wouldnt believe
Kate said I could tell stories nobody would believe
You Dont be silly Youre a child
Kate laughed You never saw such a child This is a childyesa child She laughed with a
thin penetrating shriek
The sound got through the wine that was muffling Faye She centered her eyes on Kate You
look so strange she said I guess its the lamplight You look different
I am different
Call me Mother dear
Motherdear

You bet we are You dont even know You dont know
Ive always wanted to go to Europe We could get on a ship and have nice clothesdresses
from Paris

Faye spoke pleadingly Why dont we go now We could sell the house With the business
weve got we could get maybe ten thousand dollars for it
What do you mean no Its my house I can sell it
Did you forget Im your daughter
I dont like your tone Kate Whats the matter with you Is there any more wine

Motherspill it down your neck Get it in under your corset Mother against your fat stomach
Faye wailed Kate dont be mean We were feeling so nice What do you want to go and spoil it
for
Kate wrenched the bottle from her hand Here give me that She tipped it up and drained it and
dropped it on the floor Her face was sharp and her eyes glinted The lips of her little mouth were
parted to show her small sharp teeth and the canines were longer and more pointed than the
others She laughed softly Motherdear MotherIm going to show you how to run a
whorehouse Well fix the gray slugs that come in here and dump their nasty little loadsfor a
dollar Well give them pleasure Mother dear
Faye said sharply Kate youre drunk I dont know what youre talking about
You dont Mother dear Do you want me to tell you
I want you to be sweet I want you to be like you were
Well its too late I didnt want to drink the wine But you you nasty fat worm you made me

that I had regulars Do you think Ill give them up Do you think they give me a mean little dollar
in uarters No they give me ten dollars and the price is going up all the time They cant go to

Faye wept like a child Kate she said dont talk like that Youre not like that Youre not like
that
Dear Mother sweet fat Mother take down the pants of one of my regulars Look at the
heelmarks on the groinvery pretty And the little cuts that bleed for a long time Oh Mother

Faye struggled to get out of her chair Kate pushed her back And do you know Mother dear
thats the way this whole house is going to be The price will be twenty dollars and well make
the bastards take a bath Well catch the blood on white silk handkerchiefsMother dearblood
from the little knotted whips
In her chair Faye began to scream hoarsely Kate was on her instantly with a hard hand cupped
over her mouth Dont make a noise Theres a good darling Get snot all over your daughters
handbut no noise Tentatively she took her hand away and wiped it on Fayes skirt
Faye whispered I want you out of the house I want you out I run a good house without
nastiness I want you out
I cant go Mother I cant leave you alone poor dear Her voice chilled Now Im sick of you
Sick of you She took a wineglass from the table went to the bureau and poured paregoric until
the glass was half full Here Mother drink it It will be good for you
Theres a good dear Drink it She coaxed the fluid into Faye Now one more swallowjust
one more
Faye mumbled thickly for a while and then she relaxed in her chair and slept snoring thickly
Dread began to gather in the corners of Kates mind and out of dread came panic She
remembered the other time and a nausea swept through her She gripped her hands together and
the panic grew She lighted a candle from the lamp and went unsteadily down the dark hall to the
kitchen She poured dry mustard in a glass stirred water into it until it was partly fluid and drank
it She held on to the edge of the sink while the paste went burning down She retched and
strained again and again At the end of it her heart was pounding and she was weakbut the
wine was overcome and her mind was clear
She went over the evening in her mind moving from scene to scene like a sniffing animal She
bathed her face and washed out the sink and put the mustard back on the shelf Then she went
back to Fayes room
The dawn was coming lighting up the back of Fremonts Peak so that it stood black against the
sky Faye was still snoring in her chair Kate watched her for a few moments and then she fixed
Fayes bed Kate dragged and strained and lifted the dead weight of the sleeping woman On the
bed Kate undressed Faye and washed her face and put her clothes away
The day was coming fast Kate sat beside the bed and watched the relaxed face the mouth open
lips blowing in and out
Faye made a restless movement and her dry lips slobbered a few thick words and sighed off to a
snore again
Kates eyes become alert She opened the top bureau drawer and examined the bottles which
constituted the medicine chest of the houseparegoric Pain Killer Lydia Pinkham iron wine
tonic Halls Cream Salve Epsom salts castor oil ammonia She carried the ammonia bottle to
the bed saturated a handkerchief and standing well away held the cloth over Fayes nose and
mouth
The strangling shocking fumes went in and Faye came snorting and fighting out of her black
web Her eyes were wide and terrified
Kate said Its all right Mother Its all right You had a nightmare You had a bad dream
Yes a dream and then sleep overcame her again and she fell back and began to snore but the
shock of the ammonia had lifted her up nearer consciousness and she was more restless Kate put
the bottle back in its drawer She straightened the table mopped up the spilled wine and carried
the glasses to the kitchen
The house was dusky with dawnlight creeping in around the edges of the blinds The cook stirred
in his leanto behind the kitchen groping for his clothes and putting on his clodhopper shoes
Kate moved uietly She drank two glasses of water and filled the glass again and carried it back
to Fayes room and closed the door She lifted Fayes right eyelid and the eye looked rakishly
up at her but it was not rolled back in her head Kate acted slowly and precisely She picked up
the handkerchief and smelled it Some of the ammonia had evaporated but the smell was still
sharp She laid the cloth lightly over Fayes face and when Faye twisted and turned and came
near to waking Kate took the handkerchief away and let Faye sink back This she did three times
She put the handkerchief away and picked up an ivory crochet hook from the marble top of the
bureau She turned down the cover and pressed the blunt end of the ivory against Fayes flabby
breast with a steady increasing pressure until the sleeping woman whined and writhed Then
Kate explored the sensitive places of the body with the hookunder the arm the groin the ear
the clitoris and always she removed the pressure just before Faye awakened fully
Faye was very near the surface now She whined and sniffled and tossed Kate stroked her
forehead and ran smooth fingers over her inner arm and spoke softly to her
Deardear Youre having a bad dream Come out of the bad dream Mother
Fayes breathing grew more regular She heaved a great sigh and turned on her side and settled
down with little grunts of comfort
Kate stood up from the bed and a wave of dizziness rose in her head She steadied herself then
went to the door and listened slipped out and moved cautiously to her own room She undressed
uickly and put on her nightgown and a robe and slippers She brushed her hair and put it up and
covered it with a sleeping cap and she sponged her face with Florida water She went uietly
Faye was still sleeping peacefully on her side Kate opened the door to the hall She carried the
glass of water to the bed and poured cold water in Fayes ear
Faye screamed and screamed again Ethels frightened face looked out of her room in time to
see Kate in robe and slippers at Fayes door The cook was right behind Kate and he put out his
hand to stop her
Now dont go in there Miss Kate You dont know whats in there
Nonsense Fayes in trouble Kate burst in and ran to the bed
Fayes eyes were wild and she was crying and moaning
What is it What is it dear
The cook was in the middle of the room and three sleephaggard girls stood in the doorway
Tell me what is it Kate cried
Oh darlingthe dreams the dreams I cant stand them
Kate turned to the door Shes had a nightmareshell be all night You go back to bed Ill stay
with her a while Alex bring a pot of tea
Kate was tireless The other girls remarked on it She put cold towels on Fayes aching head and
held her shoulders and the cup of tea for her She petted and babied her but the look of horror
would not go out of Fayes eyes At ten oclock Alex brought in a can of beer and without a word
put it on the bureau top Kate held a glass of it to Fayes lips
It will help darling Drink it down
I never want another drink
Nonsense Drink it down like medicine Thats a good girl Now just lie back and go to sleep
Im afraid to sleep
Were the dreams so bad
Horrible horrible
Tell me about them Mother Maybe that will help
Faye shrank back I wouldnt tell anyone How I could have dreamed them They werent like
my dreams
Poor little Mother Ilove you Kate said You go to sleep Ill keep the dreams away
Gradually Faye did slip off to sleep Kate sat beside the bed studying her
In human affairs of danger and delicacy successful conclusion is sharply limited by hurry So
often men trip by being in a rush If one were properly to perform a difficult and subtle act he
should first inspect the end to be achieved and then once he had accepted the end as desirable he
should forget it completely and concentrate solely on the means By this method he would not be
moved to false action by anxiety or hurry or fear Very few people learn this
What made Kate so effective was the fact that she had either learned it or had been born with the
knowledge Kate never hurried If a barrier arose she waited until it had disappeared before
continuing She was capable of complete relaxation between the times for action Also she was
mistress of a techniue which is the basis of good wrestlingthat of letting your opponent do the
heavy work toward his own defeat or of guiding his strength toward his weaknesses
Kate was in no hurry She thought to the end very uickly and then put it out of her mind She set
herself to work on method She built a structure and attacked it and if it showed the slightest
shakiness she tore it down and started fresh This she did only late at night or otherwise when she
was completely alone so that no change or preoccupation was noticeable in her manner Her
building was constructed of personalities materials knowledge and time She had access to the
first and last and she set about getting knowledge and materials but while she did that she set in
motion a series of imperceptible springs and pendulums and left them to pick up their own
momenta
First the cook told about the will It must have been the cook He thought he did anyway Kate
heard about it from Ethel and she confronted him in the kitchen where he was kneading bread
his hairy big arms floured to the elbows and his hands yeast bleached
Do you think it was a good thing to tell about being a witness she said mildly What do you
think Miss Faye is going to think
He looked confused But I didnt
You didnt whattell about it or think it would hurt
I dont think I
You dont think you told Only three people knew Do you think I told Or do you think Miss
Faye did She saw the puzzled look come into his eyes and knew that by now he was far from
sure that he had not told In a moment he would be sure that he had
Three of the girls uestioned Kate about the will coming to her together for mutual strength
Kate said I dont think Faye would like me to discuss it Alex should have kept his mouth shut
Their wills wavered and she said Why dont you ask Faye
Oh we wouldnt do that
But you dare to talk behind her back Come on now lets go in to her and you can ask her the
uestions
No Kate no
Well Ill have to tell her you asked Wouldnt you rather be there Dont you think she would
feel better if she knew you werent talking behind her back
Well
I know I would I always like a person who comes right out uietly she surrounded and
nudged and pushed until they stood in Fayes room
Kate said They asked me about a certain youknowwhat Alex admits he let it out
Faye was slightly puzzled Well dear I cant see that its such a secret
Kate said Oh Im glad you feel that way But you can see that I couldnt mention it until you
You think its bad to tell Kate
Oh not at all Im glad but it seemed to me that it wouldnt be loyal of me to mention it before
you did
Youre sweet Kate I dont see any harm You see girls Im alone in the world and I have taken
Kate as my daughter She takes such care of me Get the box Kate
And each girl took the will in her own hands and inspected it It was so simple they could repeat
it word for word to the other girls
They watched Kate to see how she would change perhaps become a tyrant but if anything she
was nicer to them
A week later when Kate became ill she went right on with her supervision of the house and no
one would have known if she hadnt been found standing rigid in the hall with agony printed on
her face She begged the girls not to tell Faye but they were outraged and it was Faye who
forced her to bed and called Dr Wilde
He was a nice man and a pretty good doctor He looked at her tongue felt her pulse asked her a
few intimate uestions and then tapped his lower lip
Right here he asked and exerted a little pressure on the small of her back No Here Does
this hurt So Well I think you just need a kidney flushing He left yellow green and red pills
to be taken in seuence The pills did good work
She did have one little flare up She told Faye Ill go to the doctors office
Ill ask him to come here
To bring me some more pills Nonsense Ill go in the morning
Dr Wilde was a good man and an honest man He was accustomed to say of his profession that
all he was sure of was that sulphur would cure the itch He was not casual about his practice Like
so many country doctors he was a combination doctor priest psychiatrist to his town He knew
most of the secrets weaknesses and the braveries of Salinas He never learned to take death
easily Indeed the death of a patient always gave him a sense of failure and hopeless ignorance
He was not a bold man and he used surgery only as a last and fearful resort The drugstore was
coming in to help the doctors but Dr Wilde was one of the few to maintain his own dispensary
and to compound his own prescriptions Many years of overwork and interrupted sleep had made
him a little vague and preoccupied
At eightthirty on a Wednesday morning Kate walked up Main Street climbed the stairs of the
Monterey County Bank Building and walked along the corridor until she found the door which
said Dr WildeOffice Hours
At ninethirty Dr Wilde put his buggy in the livery stable and wearily lifted out his black bag He
had been out in the Alisal presiding at the disintegration of old old lady German She had not
been able to terminate her life neatly There were codicils Even now Dr Wilde wondered
whether the tough dry stringy life was completely gone out of her She was ninetyseven and a
death certificate meant nothing to her Why she had corrected the priest who prepared her The
mystery of death was on him It often was Yesterday Allen Day thirtyseven six feet one inch
strong as a bull and valuable to four hundred acres and a large family had meekly surrendered his
life to pneumonia after a little exposure and three days of fever Dr Wilde knew it was a mystery
His eyelids felt grainy He thought he would take a sponge bath and have a drink before his first
office patients arrived with their stomach aches
He climbed the stairs and put his worn key in the lock of his office door The key would not turn
He set his bag on the floor and exerted pressure The key refused to budge He grabbed the
doorknob and pulled outward and rattled the key The door was opened from within Kate stood
in front of him
Oh good morning Lock was stuck How did you get in
It wasnt locked I was early and came in to wait
Wasnt locked He turned the key the other way and saw that sure enough the little bar
slipped out easily
Im getting old I guess he said Im forgetful He sighed I dont know why I lock it
anyway You could get in with a piece of baling wire And whod want to get in anyway He
seemed to see her for the first time I dont have office hours until eleven
Kate said I needed some more of those pills and I couldnt come later
Pills Oh yes Youre the girl from down at Fayes
Feeling better
Yes the pills help
Well they cant hurt he said Did I leave the door to the dispensary open too
Whats a dispensary
Over therethat door
I guess you must have
Getting old How is Faye
Well Im worried about her She was real sick a while ago Had cramps and went a little out of
her head
Shes had a stomach disorder before Dr Wilde said You cant live like that and eat at all
hours and be very well I cant anyway We just call it stomach trouble Comes from eating too
much and staying up all night Nowthe pills Do you remember what color
There were three kinds yellow red and green
Oh yes Yes I remember
While he poured pills into a round cardboard box she stood in the door
What a lot of medicines
Dr Wilde said Yesand the older I get the fewer I use I got some of those when I started to
practice Never used them Thats a beginners stock I was going to experimentalchemy
Nothing Here you are Tell Faye to get some sleep and eat some vegetables Ive been up all
night Let yourself out will you He went wavering back into the surgery
Kate glanced after him and then her eyes flicked over the lines of bottles and containers She
closed the dispensary door and looked around the outer office One book in the case was out of
line She pushed it back until it was shoulder to shoulder with its brothers
She picked up her big handbag from the leather sofa and left
In her own room Kate took five small bottles and a strip of scribbled paper from her handbag
She put the whole works in the toe of a stocking pushed the wad into a rubber overshoe and
stood it with its fellow in the back of her closet
During the following months a gradual change came over Fayes house The girls were sloppy
and touchy If they had been told to clean themselves and their rooms a deep resentment would
have set in and the house would have reeked of ill temper But it didnt work that way
Kate said at table one evening that she had just happened to look in Ethels room and it was so
neat and pretty she couldnt help buying her a present When Ethel unwrapped the package right
at the table it was a big bottle of Hoyts German enough to keep her smelling sweet for a long
time Ethel was pleased and she hoped Kate hadnt seen the dirty clothes under the bed After
supper she not only got the clothes out but brushed the floors and swept the cobwebs out of the
corners
Then Grace looked so pretty one afternoon that Kate couldnt help giving her the rhinestone
butterfly pin she was wearing And Grace had to rush up and put on a clean shirtwaist to set it off
Alex in the kitchen who if he had believed what was usually said of him would have considered
himself a murderer found that he had a magic hand with biscuits He discovered that cooking
was something you couldnt learn You had to feel it
Cotton Eye learned that nobody hated him His tubthumping piano playing changed
imperceptibly
He told Kate Its funny what you remember when you think back
Like what she asked
Well like this and he played for her
Thats lovely she said What is it
Well I dont know I think its Chopin If I could just see the music
He told her how he had lost his sight and he had never told anyone else It was a bad story That
Saturday night he took the chain off the piano strings and played something he had been
remembering and practicing in the morning something called Moonlight a piece by
Beethoven Cotton Eye thought
Ethel said it sounded like moonlight and did he know the words
It dont have words said Cotton Eye
Oscar Trip up from Gonzales for Saturday night said Well it ought to have Its pretty
One night there were presents for everyone because Fayes was the best house the cleanest and
nicest in the whole countyand who was responsible for that Why the girlswho else And
did they ever taste seasoning like in that stew
Alex retired into the kitchen and shyly wiped his eyes with the back of his wrist He bet he could
make a plum pudding would knock their eyes out
Georgia was getting up at ten every morning and taking piano lessons from Cotton Eye and her
nails were clean
Coming back from eleven oclock mass on a Sunday morning Grace said to Trixie And I was
about ready to get married and give up whoring Can you imagine
Its sure nice said Trixie Jennys girls came over for Fayes birthday cake and they couldnt
believe their eyes They dont talk about nothing else but how it is at Fayes Jennys sore
Did you see the score on the blackboard this morning
Sure I dideightyseven tricks in one week Let Jenny or the Nigger match that when there
aint no holidays
No holidays hell Have you forgot its Lent They aint turning a trick at Jennys
After her illness and her evil dreams Faye was uiet and depressed Kate knew she was being
watched but there was no help for that And she had made sure the rolled paper was still in the
box and all the girls had seen it or heard about it
One afternoon Faye looked up from her solitaire game as Kate knocked and entered the room
How do you feel Mother
Fine just fine Her eyes were secretive Faye wasnt very clever You know Kate Id like to
go to Europe
Well how wonderful And you deserve it and you can afford it
I dont want to go alone I want you to go with me
Kate looked at her in astonishment Me You want to take me
Sure why not
Oh you sweet dear When can we go
You want to
Ive always dreamed of it When can we go Lets go soon
Fayes eyes lost their suspicion and her face relaxed Maybe next summer she said We can
plan it for next summer Kate
Yes Mother
Youyou dont turn any tricks any more do you
Why should I You take such good care of me
Faye slowly gathered up the cards and tapped them suare and dropped them in the table drawer
Kate pulled up a chair I want to ask your advice about something
Well you know Im trying to help you
Youre doing everything darling
You know our biggest expense is food and it gets bigger in the winter
Well right now you can buy fruit and all kinds of vegetables for two bits a lug And in the
winter you know what we pay for canned peaches and canned string beans
You arent planning to start preserving
Well why shouldnt we
What will Alex say to that
Mother you can believe it or not or you can ask him Alex suggested it
Well he did Cross my heart
Well Ill be damnedOh Im sorry sweet It slipped out
The kitchen turned into a cannery and all the girls helped Alex truly believed it was his idea At
the end of the season he had a silver watch with his name engraved on the back to prove it
Ordinarily both Faye and Kate had their supper at the long table in the dining room but on
Sunday nights when Alex was off and the girls dined on thick sandwiches Kate served supper
for two in Fayes room It was pleasant and a ladylike time There was always some little
delicacy very special and goodfoie gras or a tossed salad pastry bought at Langs Bakery just
across Main Street And instead of the white oilcloth and paper napkins of the dining room
Fayes table was covered with a white damask cloth and the napkins were linen It had a party
feeling too candles andsomething rare in Salinasa bowl of flowers Kate could make pretty
floral arrangements using only the blossoms from weeds she picked in the fields
What a clever girl she is Faye would say She can do anything and she can make do with
anything Were going to Europe And did you know Kate speaks French Well she can When
you get her alone ask her to say something in French Shes teaching me Know how you say
bread in French Faye was having a wonderful time Kate gave her excitement and perpetual
planning
On Saturday the fourteenth of October the first wild ducks went over Salinas Faye saw them
from her window a great wedge flying south When Kate came in before supper as she always
did Faye told her about it I guess the winters nearly here she said Well have to get Alex to
set up the stoves
Ready for your tonic Mother dear
Yes I am Youre making me lazy waiting on me
I like to wait on you said Kate She took the bottle of Lydia Pinkhams Vegetable Compound
from the drawer and held it up to the light Not much left she said Well have to get some
Oh I think I have three bottles left of the dozen in my closet
Kate picked up the glass Theres a fly in the glass she said Ill just go and wash it out
In the kitchen she rinsed the glass From her pocket she took the eyedropper The end was closed
with a little piece of potato the way you plug the spout of a kerosene can She carefully sueezed
a few drops of clear liuid into the glass a tincture of nux vomica
Back in Fayes room she poured the three tablespoons of vegetable compound in the glass and
stirred it
Faye drank her tonic and licked her lips It tastes bitter she said
Does it dear Let nie taste Kate took a spoonful from the bottle and made a face So it does
she said I guess its been standing around too long Im going to throw it out Say that is bitter
Let me get you a glass of water
At supper Fayes face was flushed She stopped eating and seemed to be listening
Whats the matter Kate asked Mother whats the matter
Faye seemed to tear her attention away Why I dont know I guess a little heart flutter Just all
of a sudden I felt afraid and my heart got to pounding
Dont you want me to help you to your room
No dear I feel all right now
Grace put down her fork Well you got a real high flush Faye
Kate said I dont like it I wish youd see Dr Wilde
No its all right now
You frightened me said Kate Have you ever had it before
Well Im a little short of breath sometimes I guess Im getting too stout
Faye didnt feel very good that Saturday night and about ten oclock Kate persuaded her to go to
bed Kate looked in several times until she was sure Faye was asleep
The next day Faye felt all right I guess Im just shortwinded she said
Well were going to have invalid food for my darling said Kate Ive made some chicken
soup for you and well have a stringbean saladthe way you like it just oil and vinegar and a
cup of tea
Honest to God Kate I feel pretty good
It wouldnt hurt either of us to eat a little light You frightened me last night I had an aunt who
died of heart trouble And that leaves a memory you know
I never had any trouble with my heart Just a little shortwinded when I climb the stairs
In the kitchen Kate set the supper on two trays She measured out the French dressing in a cup
and poured it on the stringbean salad On Fayes tray she put her favorite cup and set the soup
forward on the stove to heat Finally she took the eyedropper from her pocket and sueezed two
drops of croton oil on the string beans and stirred it in She went to her room and swallowed the
contents of a small bottle of Cascara Sagrada and hurried back to the kitchen She poured the hot
soup in the cups filled the teapot with boiling water and carried the trays to Fayes room
I didnt think I was hungry Faye said But that soup smells good
I made a special salad dressing for you said Kate Its an old recipe rosemary and thyme See
if you like it
Why its delicious said Faye Is there anything you cant do darling
Kate was stricken first Her forehead beaded with perspiration and she doubled over crying with
pain Her eyes were staring and the saliva ran from her mouth Faye ran to the hallway screaming
for help The girls and a few Sunday customers crowded into the room Kate was writhing on the
floor Two of the regulars lifted her onto Fayes bed and tried to straighten her out but she
screamed and doubled up again The sweat poured from her body and wet her clothes
Faye was wiping Kates forehead with a towel when the pain struck her
It was an hour before Dr Wilde could be found playing euchre with a friend He was dragged
down to the Line by two hysterical whores Faye and Kate were weak from vomiting and diarrhea
and the spasms continued at intervals
Dr Wilde said What did you eat And then he noticed the trays Are these string beans home
canned he demanded
Sure said Grace We did them right here
Did any of you have them
Well no You see
Go out and break every jar Dr Wilde said Goddam the string beans And he unpacked his
stomach pump
On Tuesday he sat with the two pale weak women Kates bed had been moved into Fayes room
I can tell you now he said I didnt think you had a chance Youre pretty lucky And let home
made string beans alone Buy canned ones
What is it Kate asked
Botulism We dont know much about it but damn few ever get over it I guess its because
youre young and shes tough He asked Faye Are you still bleeding from the bowels
Yes a little
Well here are some morphine pills Theyll bind you up Youve probably ruptured something
But they say you cant kill a whore Now take it easy both of you
That was October
Faye was never really well again She would make a little gain and then go to pieces She had a
bad time on December  and it took even longer for her to gain her strength February  the
bleeding became violent and the strain seemed to have weakened Fayes heart Dr Wilde listened
a long time through his stethoscope
Kate was haggard and her slender body had shrunk to bones The girls tried to spell her with
Faye but Kate would not leave
Grace said God knows whens the last sleep she had If Faye was to die I think it would kill that
girl
Shes just as like to blow her brains out said Ethel
Dr Wilde took Kate into the daydarkened parlor and put his black bag on the chair I might as
well tell you he said Her heart just cant take the strain Im afraid Shes all torn up inside
That goddam botulism Worse than a rattlesnake He looked away from Kates haggard face I
thought it would be better to tell you so you can prepare yourself he said lamely and put his
hand on her bony shoulder Not many people have such loyalty Give her a little warm milk if
she can take it
Kate carried a basin of warm water to the table beside the bed When Trixie looked in Kate was
bathing Faye and using the fine linen napkins to do it Then she brushed the lank blond hair and
braided it
Fayes skin had shrunk clinging to jaw and skull and her eyes were huge and vacant
She tried to speak and Kate said Shush Save your strength Save your strength
She went to the kitchen for a glass of warm milk and put it on the bedside table She took two
little bottles from her pocket and sucked a little from each one into the eyedropper Open up
Mother This is a new kind of medicine Now be brave dear This will taste bad She sueezed
the fluid far back on Fayes tongue and held up her head so she could drink a little milk to take
away the taste Now you rest and Ill be back in a little while
Kate slipped uietly out of the room The kitchen was dark She opened the outer door and crept
out and moved back among the weeds The ground was damp from the spring rains At the back
of the lot she dug a small hole with a pointed stick She dropped in a number of small thin bottles
and an eyedropper With the stick she crushed the glass to bits and scraped dirt over them Rain
was beginning to fall as Kate went back to the house
At first they had to tie Kate down to keep her from hurting herself From violence she went into a
gloomy stupor It was a long time before she regained her health And she forgot completely
about the will It was Trixie who finally remembered
On the Trask place Adam drew into himself The unfinished Sanchez house lay open to wind
and rain and the new floorboards buckled and warped with moisture The laidout vegetable
gardens rioted with weeds
Adam seemed clothed in a viscosity that slowed his movements and held his thoughts down He
saw the world through gray water Now and then his mind fought its way upward and when the
light broke in it brought him only a sickness of the mind and he retired into the grayness again
He was aware of the twins because he heard them cry and laugh but he felt only a thin distaste
for them To Adam they were symbols of his loss His neighbors drove up into his little valley
and every one of them would have understood anger or sorrowand so helped him But they
could do nothing with the cloud that hung over him Adam did not resist them He simply did not
see them and before long the neighbors stopped driving up the road under the oaks
For a time Lee tried to stimulate Adam to awareness but Lee was a busy man He cooked and
washed he bathed the twins and fed them Through his hard and constant work he grew fond of
the two little boys He talked to them in Cantonese and Chinese words were the first they
recognized and tried to repeat
Samuel Hamilton went back twice to try to wedge Adam up and out of his shock Then Liza
stepped in
I want you to stay away from there she said You come back a changed man Samuel you
dont change him He changes you I can see the look of him in your face
Have you thought of the two little boys Liza he asked
Ive thought of your own family she said snappishly You lay a crepe on us for days after
All right Mother he said but it saddened him because Samuel could not mind his own
business when there was pain in any man It was no easy thing for him to abandon Adam to his
desolation
Adam had paid him for his work had even paid him for the windmill parts and did not want the
windmills Samuel sold the euipment and sent Adam the money He had no answer
He became aware of an anger at Adam Trask It seemed to Samuel that Adam might be
pleasuring himself with sadness But there was little leisure to brood Joe was off to collegeto
that school Leland Stanford had built on his farm near Palo Alto Tom worried his father for
Tom grew deeper and deeper into books He did his work well enough but Samuel felt that Tom
had not joy enough
Will and George were doing well in business and Joe was writing letters home in rhymed verse
and making as smart an attack on all the accepted verities as was healthful
Samuel wrote to Joe saying I would be disappointed if you had not become an atheist and I
read pleasantly that you have in your age and wisdom accepted agnosticism the way youd take
a cookie on a full stomach But I would ask you with all my understanding heart not to try to
convert your mother Your last letter only made her think you are not well Your mother does not
believe there are many ills uncurable by good strong soup She puts your brave attack on the
structure of our civilization down to a stomach ache It worries her Her faith is a mountain and
you my son havent even got a shovel yet
Liza was getting old Samuel saw it in her face and he could not feel old himself white beard or
no But Liza was living backwards and thats the proof
There was a time when she looked on his plans and prophecies as the crazy shoutings of a child
Now she felt that they were unseemly in a grown man They three Liza and Tom and Samuel
were alone on the ranch Una was married to a stranger and gone away Dessie had her
dressmaking business in Salinas Olive had married her young man and Mollie was married and
living believe it or not in an apartment in San Francisco There was perfume and a white
bearskin rug in the bedroom in front of the fireplace and Mollie smoked a goldtipped cigarette
Violet Milowith her coffee after dinner
One day Samuel strained his back lifting a bale of hay and it hurt his feelings more than his back
for he could not imagine a life in which Sam Hamilton was not privileged to lift a bale of hay He
felt insulted by his back almost as he would have been if one of his children had been dishonest
In King City Dr Tilson felt him over The doctor grew more testy with his overworked years
You sprained your back
That I did said Samuel
And you drove all the way in to have me tell you that you sprained your back and charge you
two dollars
Heres your two dollars
And you want to know what to do about it
Sure I do
Dont sprain it any more Now take your money back Youre not a fool Samuel unless youre
getting childish
But it hurts
Of course it hurts How would you know it was strained if it didnt
Samuel laughed Youre good for me he said Youre more than two dollars good for me
Keep the money
The doctor looked closely at him I think youre telling the truth Samuel Ill keep the money
Samuel went in to see Will in his fine new store He hardly knew his son for Will was getting fat
and prosperous and he wore a coat and vest and a gold ring on his little finger
Ive got a package made up for Mother Will said Some little cans of things from France
Mushrooms and liver paste and sardines so little you can hardly see them
Shell just send them to Joe said Samuel
Cant you make her eat them
No said his father But shell enjoy sending them to Joe
Lee came into the store and his eyes lighted up How do Missy he said
Hello Lee How are the boys
Boys fine
Samuel said Im going to have a glass of beer next door Lee Be glad to have you join me
Lee and Samuel sat at the little round table in the barroom and Samuel drew figures on the
scrubbed wood with the moisture of his beer glass Ive wanted to go to see you and Adam but I
didnt think I could do any good
Well you cant do any harm I thought hed get over it But he still walks around like a ghost
Its over a year isnt it Samuel asked
Three months over
Well what do you think I can do
I dont know said Lee Maybe you could shock him out of it Nothing else has worked
Im not good at shocking Id probably end up by shocking myself By the way what did he
name the twins
They dont have any names
Youre making a joke Lee
I am not making jokes
What does he call them
He calls them they
I mean when he speaks to them
When he speaks to them he calls them you one or both
This is nonsense Samuel said angrily What kind of fool is the man
Ive meant to come and tell you Hes a dead man unless you can wake him up
Samuel said Ill come Ill bring a horse whip No names Youre damn right Ill come Lee
When
Tomorrow
Ill kill a chicken said Lee Youll like the twins Mr Hamilton Theyre finelooking boys I
wont tell Mr Trask youre coming
Shyly Samuel told his wife he wanted to visit the Trask place He thought she would pile up
strong walls of objection and for one of the few times in his life he would disobey her wish no
matter how strong her objection It gave him a sad feeling in the stomach to think of disobeying
his wife He explained his purpose almost as though he were confessing Liza put her hands on
her hips during the telling and his heart sank When he was finished she continued to look at him
he thought coldly
Finally she said Samuel do you think you can move this rock of a man
Why I dont know Mother He had not expected this I dont know
Do you think it is such an important matter that those babies have names right now
Well it seemed so to me he said lamely
Samuel do you think why you want to go Is it your natural incurable nosiness Is it your black
inability to mind your own business
Now Liza I know my failings pretty well I thought it might be more than that
It had better be more than that she said This man has not admitted that his sons live He has
cut them off midair
Thats the way it seems to me Liza
If he tells you to mind your own businesswhat then
Well I dont know
Her jaw snapped shut and her teeth clicked If you do not get those boys named therell be no
warm place in this house for you Dont you dare come whining back saying he wouldnt do it or
he wouldnt listen If you do Ill have to go myself
Ill give him the back of my hand Samuel said
No that you wont do You fall short in savagery Samuel I know you Youll give him sweet
sounding words and youll come dragging back and try to make me forget you ever went
Ill beat his brains out Samuel shouted
He slammed into the bedroom and Liza smiled at the panels
He came out soon in his black suit and his hard shiny shirt and collar He stooped down to her
while she tied his black string tie His white beard was brushed to shining
Youd best take a swab at your shoes with a blacking brush she said
In the midst of painting the blacking on his worn shoes he looked sideways up at her Could I
take the Bible along he asked Theres no place for getting a good name like the Bible
I dont much like it out of the house she said uneasily And if youre late coming home
whatll I have for my reading And the childrens names are in it She saw his face fall She
went into the bedroom and came back with a small Bible worn and scuffed its cover held on by
brown paper and glue Take this one she said
But thats your mothers
She wouldnt mind And all the names but one in here have two dates
Ill wrap it so it wont get hurt said Samuel
Liza spoke sharply What my mother would mind is what I mind and Ill tell you what I mind
Youre never satisfied to let the Testament alone Youre forever picking at it and uestioning it
You turn it over the way a coon turns over a wet rock and it angers me
Im just trying to understand it Mother
What is there to understand Just read it There it is in black and white Who wants you to
understand it If the Lord God wanted you to understand it Hed have given you to understand or
Hed have set it down different
But Mother
Samuel she said youre the most contentious man this world has ever seen
Dont agree with me all the time It hints of insincerity Speak up for yourself
She looked after his dark figure in the buggy as he drove away Hes a sweet husband she said
aloud but contentious
And Samuel was thinking with wonder Just when I think I know her she does a thing like that
On the last halfmile turning out of the Salinas Valley and driving up the unscraped road under
the great oak trees Samuel tried to plait a rage to take care of his embarrassment He said heroic
words to himself
Adam was more gaunt than Samuel remembered His eyes were dull as though he did not use
them much for seeing It took a little time for Adam to become aware that Samuel was standing
before him A grimace of displeasure drew down his mouth
Samuel said I feel small nowcoming uninvited as I have
Adam said What do you want Didnt I pay you
Pay Samuel asked Yes you did Yes by God you did And Ill tell you that pay has been
more than Ive merited by the nature of it
What What are you trying to say
Samuels anger grew and put out leaves A man his whole life matches himself against pay
And how if its my whole lifes work to find my worth can you sad man write me down instant
in a ledger
Adam exclaimed Ill pay I tell you Ill pay How much Ill pay
You have but not to me
Why did you come then Go away
You once invited me
I dont invite you now
Samuel put his hands on his hips and leaned forward Ill tell you now uiet In a bitter night a
mustard night that was last night a good thought came and the dark was sweetened when the day
sat down And this thought went from evening star to the late dipper on the edge of the first light
that our betters spoke of So I invite myself
You are not welcome
Samuel said Im told that out of some singular glory your loins got twins
What business is that of yours
A kind of joy lighted Samuels eyes at the rudeness He saw Lee lurking inside the house and
peeking out at him Dont for the love of God put violence on me Im a man hopes therell be
a picture of peace on my hatchments
I dont understand you
How could you Adam Trask a dog wolf with a pair of cubs a scrubby rooster with sweet
paternity for a fertilized egg A dirty clod
A darkness covered Adams cheeks and for the first time his eyes seemed to see Samuel joyously
felt hot rage in his stomach He cried Oh my friend retreat from me Please I beg of you The
saliva dampened the corners of his mouth Please he cried For the love of any holy thing you
can remember step back from me I feel murder nudging my gizzard
Adam said Get off my place Go onget off Youre acting crazy Get off This is my place I
bought it
You bought your eyes and nose Samuel jeered You bought your uprightness You bought
your thumb on sideways Listen to me because Im like to kill you after You bought You
bought out of some sweet inheritance Think nowdo you deserve your children man
Deserve them Theyre hereI guess I dont understand you
Samuel wailed God save me Liza Its not the way you think Adam Listen to me before my
thumb finds the bad place at your throat The precious twinsuntried unnoticed undirected
and I say it uiet with my hands downundiscovered
Get off said Adam hoarsely Lee bring a gun This man is crazy Lee
Then Samuels hands were on Adams throat pressing the throbbing up to his temples swelling
his eyes with blood And Samuel was snarling at him Tear away with your jelly fingers You
have not bought these boys nor stolen them nor passed any bit for them You have them by
some strange and lovely dispensation Suddenly he plucked his hard thumbs out of his neigh
bors throat
Adam stood panting He felt his throat where the blacksmith hands had been What is it you
want of me
You have no love
I hadenough to kill me
No one ever had enough The stone orchard celebrates too little not too much
Stay away from me I can fight back Dont think I cant defend myself
You have two weapons and they not named
Ill fight you old man You are an old man
Samuel said I cant think in my mind of a dull man picking up a rock who before evening
would not put a name to itlike Peter And youfor a year youve lived with your hearts
draining and youve not even laid a number to the boys
Adam said What I do is my own business
Samuel struck him with a workheavy fist and Adam sprawled out in the dust Samuel asked him
to rise and when Adam accepted struck him again and this time Adam did not get up He looked
stonily at the menacing old man
The fire went out of Samuels eyes and he said uietly Your sons have no names
Adam replied Their mother left them motherless
And you have left them fatherless Cant you feel the cold at night of a lone child What warm is
there what bird song what possible morning can be good Dont you remember Adam how it
was even a little
I didnt do it Adam said
Have you undone it Your boys have no names He stooped down and put his arms around
Adams shoulders and helped him to his feet Well give them names he said Well think
long and find good names to clothe them He whipped the dust from Adams shirt with his
hands
Adam wore a faraway yet intent look as though he were listening to some windcarried music
but his eyes were not dead as they had been He said Its hard to imagine Id thank a man for
insults and for shaking me out like a rug But Im grateful Its a hurty thanks but its thanks
Samuel smiled crinkleeyed Did it seem natural Did I do it right he asked
Well in a way I promised my wife Id do it She didnt believe I would Im not a fighting man
you see The last time I clobbered a human soul it was over a rednosed girl and a Schoolbook in
County Derry
Adam stared at Samuel but in his mind he saw and felt his brother Charles black and murderous
and that sight switched to Cathy and the uality of her eyes over the gun barrel There wasnt
any fear in it Adam said It was more like a weariness
I guess I was not angry enough
Samuel Ill ask just once and then no more Have you heard anything Has there been any news
of herany news at all
Ive heard nothing
Its almost a relief said Adam
Do you have hatred
No Noonly a kind of sinking in the heart Maybe later Ill sort it out to hatred There was no
interval from loveliness to horror you see Im confused confused
Samuel said One day well sit and youll lay it out on the table neat like a solitaire deck but
nowwhy you cant find all the cards
From behind the shed there came the indignant shrieking of an outraged chicken and then a dull
thump
Theres something at the hens said Adam
A second shrieking started Its Lee at the hens said Samuel You know if chickens had
government and church and history they would take a distant and distasteful view of human joy
Let any gay and hopeful thing happen to a man and some chicken goes howling to the block
Now the two men were silent breaking it only with small false courtesiesmeaningless inuiries
about health and weather with answers unlistened to And this might have continued until they
were angry at each other again if Lee had not interfered
Lee brought out a table and two chairs and set the chairs facing each other He made another trip
for a pint of whisky and two glasses and set a glass on the table in front of each chair Then he
carried out the twins one under each arm and put them on the ground beside the table and gave
each boy a stick for his hand to shake and make shadows with
The boys sat solemnly and looked about stared at Samuels beard and searched for Lee The
strange thing about them was their clothing for the boys were dressed in the straight trousers and
the frogged and braided jackets of the Chinese One was in turuoise blue and the other in a faded
rose pink and the frogs and braid were black On their heads sat round black silken hats each
with a bright red button on its flat top
Samuel asked Where in the world did you get those clothes Lee
I didnt get them Lee said testily I had them The only other clothes they have I made myself
out of sail cloth A boy should be well dressed on his naming day
Youve dropped the pidgin Lee
I hope for good Of course I use it in King City He addressed a few short sung syllables to the
boys on the ground and they both smiled up at him and waved their sticks in the air Lee said
Ill pour you a drink Its some that was here
Its some you bought yesterday in King City said Samuel
Now that Samuel and Adam were seated together and the barriers were down a curtain of
shyness fell on Samuel What he had beaten in with his fists he could not supplement easily He
thought of the virtues of courage and forbearance which become flabby when there is nothing to
use them on His mind grinned inward at itself
The two sat looking at the twin boys in their strange brightcolored clothes Samuel thought
Sometimes your opponent can help you more than your friend He lifted his eyes to Adam
Its hard to start he said And its like a putoff letter that gathers difficulties to itself out of
the minutes Could you give me a hand
Adam looked up for a moment and then back at the boys on the ground Theres a crashing in
my head he said Like sounds you hear under water Im having to dig myself out of a year
Maybe youll tell me how it was and that will get us started
Adam tossed down his drink and poured another and rolled the glass at an angle in his hand The
amber whisky moved high on the side and the pungent fruit odor of its warming filled the air
Its hard to remember he said It was not agony but a dullness But nothere were needles in
it You said I had not all the cards in the deckand I was thinking of that Maybe Ill never have
all the cards
Is it herself trying to come out When a man says he does not want to speak of something he
usually means he can think of nothing else
Maybe its that Shes all mixed up with the dullness and I cant remember much except the
last picture drawn in fire
She did shoot you didnt she Adam
His lips grew thin and his eyes black
Samuel said Theres no need to answer
Theres no reason not to Adam replied Yes she did
Did she mean to kill you
Ive thought of that more than anything else No I dont think she meant to kill me She didnt
allow me that dignity There was no hatred in her no passion at all I learned about that in the
army If you want to kill a man you shoot at head or heart or stomach No she hit me where she
intended I can see the gun barrel moving over I guess I wouldnt have minded so much if she
had wanted my death That would have been a kind of love But I was an annoyance not an
enemy
Youve given it a lot of thought said Samuel
Ive had lots of time for it I want to ask you something I cant remember behind the last ugly
thing Was she very beautiful Samuel
To you she was because you built her I dont think you ever saw heronly your own creation
Adam mused aloud I wonder who she waswhat she was I was content not to know
And now you want to
Adam dropped his eyes Its not curiosity But I would like to know what kind of blood is in my
boys When they grow upwont I be looking for something in them
Yes you will And I will warn you now that not their blood but your suspicion might build evil
in them They will be what you expect of them
But their blood
I dont very much believe in blood said Samuel I think when a man finds good or bad in his
children he is seeing only what he planted in them after they cleared the womb
You cant make a race horse of a pig
No said Samuel but you can make a very fast pig
No one hereabouts would agree with you I think even Mrs Hamilton would not
Thats exactly right She most of all would disagree and so I would not say it to her and let
loose the thunder of her disagreement She wins all arguments by the use of vehemence and the
conviction that a difference of opinion is a personal affront Shes a fine woman but you have
to learn to feel your way with her Lets speak of the boys
Will you have another drink
That I will thank you Names are a great mystery Ive never known whether the name is
molded by the child or the child changed to fit the name But you can be sure of thiswhenever a
human has a nickname it is a proof that the name given him was wrong How do you favor the
standard namesJohn or James or Charles
Adam was looking at the twins and suddenly with the mention of the name he saw his brother
peering out of the eyes of one of the boys He leaned forward
What is it Samuel asked
Why Adam cried these boys are not alike They dont look alike
Of course they dont Theyre not identical twins
That onethat one looks like my brother I just saw it I wonder if the other looks like me
Both of them do A face has everything in it right back to the beginning
Its not so much now said Adam But for a moment I thought I was seeing a ghost
Maybe thats what ghosts are Samuel observed
Lee brought dishes out and put them on the table
Do you have Chinese ghosts Samuel asked
Millions said Lee We have more ghosts than anything else I guess nothing in China ever
dies Its very crowded Anyway thats the feeling I got when I was there
Samuel said Sit down Lee Were trying to think of names
Ive got chicken frying It will be ready pretty soon
Adam looked up from the twins and his eyes were warmed and softened Will you have a drink
Lee
Im nipping at the ogkapy in the kitchen said Lee and went back to the house
Samuel leaned down and gathered up one of the boys and held him on his lap Take that one
up he said to Adam We ought to see whether theres something that draws names to them
Adam held the other child awkwardly on his knee They look some alike he said but not
when you look close This one has rounder eyes than that one
Yes and a rounder head and bigger ears Samuel added But this one is more likelike a
bullet This one might go farther but not so high And this one is going to be darker in the hair
and skin This one will be shrewd I think and shrewdness is a limitation on the mind
Shrewdness tells you what you must not do because it would not be shrewd See how this one
supports himself Hes farther along than that onebetter developed Isnt it strange how
different they are when you look close
Adams face was changing as though he had opened and come out on his surface He held up his
finger and the child made a lunge for it and missed and nearly fell off his lap Whoa said
Adam Take it easy Do you want to fall
It would be a mistake to name them for ualities we think they have Samuel said We might
be wrongso wrong Maybe it would be good to give them a high mark to shoot ata name to
live up to The man Im named for had his name called clear by the Lord God and Ive been
listening all my life And once or twice Ive thought I heard my name calledbut not clear not
clear
Adam holding the child by his upper arm leaned over and poured whisky in both glasses I
thank you for coming Samuel he said I even thank you for hitting me Thats a strange thing
to say
It was a strange thing for me to do Liza will never believe it and so Ill never tell her An
unbelieved truth can hurt a man much more than a lie It takes great courage to back truth
unacceptable to our times Theres a punishment for it and its usually crucifixion I havent the
courage for that
Adam said Ive wondered why a man of your knowledge would work a desert hill place
Its because I havent courage said Samuel I could never uite take the responsibility When
the Lord God did not call my name I might have called His namebut I did not There you have
the difference between greatness and mediocrity Its not an uncommon disease But its nice
for a mediocre man to know that greatness must be the loneliest state in the world
Id think there are degrees of greatness Adam said
I dont think so said Samuel That would be like saying there is a little bigness No I believe
when you come to that responsibility the hugeness and you are alone to make your choice On
one side you have warmth and companionship and sweet understanding and on the othercold
lonely greatness There you make your choice Im glad I chose mediocrity but how am I to say
what reward might have come with the other None of my children will be great either except
perhaps Tom Hes suffering over the choosing right now Its a painful thing to watch And
somewhere in me I want him to say yes Isnt that strange A father to want his son condemned to
greatness What selfishness that must be
Adam chuckled This naming is no simple business I see
Did you think it would be
I didnt know it could be so pleasant said Adam
Lee came out with a platter of fried chicken a bowl of smoking boiled potatoes and a deep dish
of pickled beets all carried on a pastry board I dont know how good it will be he said The
hens are a little old We dont have any pullets The weasels got the baby chicks this year
Pull up said Samuel
Wait until I get my ngkapy said Lee
While he was gone Adam said Its strange to mehe used to speak differently
He trusts you now Samuel said He has a gift of resigned loyalty without hope of reward
Hes maybe a much better man than either of us could dream of being
Lee came back and took his seat at the end of the table Just put the boys on the ground he said
The twins protested when they were set down Lee spoke to them sharply in Cantonese and they
were silent
The men ate uietly as nearly all country people do Suddenly Lee got up and hurried into the
house He came back with a jug of red wine I forgot it he said I found it in the house
Adam laughed I remember drinking wine here before I bought the place Maybe I bought the
place because of the wine The chickens good Lee I dont think Ive been aware of the taste of
food for a long time
Youre getting well Samuel said Some people think its an insult to the glory of their
sickness to get well But the time poultice is no respecter of glories Everyone gets well if he
waits around
Lee cleared the table and gave each of the boys a clean drumstick They sat solemnly holding
their greasy batons and alternately inspecting and sucking them The wine and the glasses stayed
Wed best get on with the naming Samuel said I can feel a little tightening on my halter from
Liza
I cant think what to name them Adam said
You have no family name you wantno inviting trap for a rich relative no proud name to re
create
No Id like them to start fresh insofar as that is possible
Samuel knocked his forehead with his knuckles What a shame he said What a shame it is
that the proper names for them they cannot have
What do you mean Adam asked
Freshness you said I thought last night He paused Have you thought of your own name
Mine
Of course Your firstbornCain and Abel
Adam said Oh no No we cant do that
I know we cant That would be tempting whatever fate there is But isnt it odd that Cain is
maybe the bestknown name in the whole world and as far as I know only one man has ever
borne it
Lee said Maybe thats why the name has never changed its emphasis
Adam looked into the inkred wine in his glass I got a shiver when you mentioned it he said
Two stories have haunted us and followed us from our beginning Samuel said We carry them
along with us like invisible tailsthe story of original sin and the story of Cain and Abel And I
dont understand either of them I dont understand them at all but I feel them Liza gets angry
with me She says I should not try to understand them She says why should we try to explain a
verity Maybe shes rightmaybe shes right Lee Liza says youre a Presbyteriando you
understand the Garden of Eden and Cain and Abel
She thought I should be something and I went to Sunday School long ago in San Francisco
People like you to be something preferably what they are
Adam said He asked you if you understood
I think I understand the Fall I could perhaps feel that in myself But the brother murderno
Well maybe I dont remember the details very well
Samuel said Most people dont read the details Its the details that astonish me And Abel had
no children He looked up at the sky Lord how the day passes Its like a lifeso uickly
when we dont watch it and so slowly when we do No he said Im having enjoyment And I
made a promise to myself that I would not consider enjoyment a sin I take a pleasure in inuiring
into things Ive never been content to pass a stone without looking under it And it is a black
disappointment to me that I can never see the far side of the moon
I dont have a Bible Adam said I left the family one in Connecticut
I have said Lee Ill get it
No need said Samuel Liza let me take her mothers Its here in my pocket He took out the
package and unwrapped the battered book This one has been scraped and gnawed at he said
I wonder what agonies have settled here Give me a used Bible and I will I think be able to tell
you about a man by the places that are edged with the dirt of seeking fingers Liza wears a Bible
down evenly Here we arethis oldest story If it troubles us it must be that we find the trouble in
ourselves
I havent heard it since I was a child said Adam
You think its long then and its very short said Samuel Ill read it through and then well go
back Give me a little wine my throats dried out with wine Here it issuch a little story to have
made so deep a wound He looked down at the ground See he said The boys have gone to
their sleep there in the dust
Lee got up Ill cover them he said
The dust is warm said Samuel Now it goes this way And Adam knew Eve his wife and she
conceived and bare Cain and said I have gotten a man from the Lord
Adam started to speak and Samuel looked up at him and he was silent and covered his eyes with
his hand Samuel read  And she again bare his brother Abel And Abel was a keeper of sheep
but Cain was a tiller of the ground And in the process of time it came to pass that Cain brought
of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the Lord And Abel he also brought of the firstlings of
his flock and of the fat thereof And the Lord had respect unto Abel and to his offering But unto
Cain and to his offering he had not respect
Lee said Now thereno go on go on Well come back
Samuel read  And Cain was very wroth and his countenance fell And the Lord said unto Cain
Why art thou wroth And why is thy countenance fallen If thou doest well shalt thou not be
accepted And if thou doest not well sin lieth at the door And unto thee shall be his desire and
thou shalt rule over him
And Cain talked with Abel his brother and it came to pass when they were in the field that
Cain rose up against Abel his brother and slew him And the Lord said unto Cain Where is Abel
thy brother And he said I know not Am I my brothers keeper And he said What hast
thou done The voice of thy brothers blood crieth unto me from the ground And now art thou
cursed from the earth which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brothers blood from thy hand
When thou tillest the ground it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength a fugitive and a
vagabond shalt thou be in the earth And Cain said unto the Lord My punishment is greater
than I can bear Behold thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth and from thy
face shall I be hid And I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth and it shall come to pass
that everyone that findeth me shall slay me And the Lord said unto him Therefore whosoever
slayeth Cain vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold And the Lord set a mark upon Cain
lest any finding him should kill him And Cain went out from the presence of the Lord and dwelt
in the land of Nod on the east of Eden
Samuel closed the loose cover of the book almost with weariness There it is he said Sixteen
verses no more And oh Lord I had forgotten how dreadful it isno single tone of
encouragement Maybe Lizas right Theres nothing to understand
Adam sighed deeply Its not a comforting story is it
Lee poured a tumbler full of dark liuor from his round stone bottle and sipped it and opened his
mouth to get the double taste on the back of his tongue No story has power nor will it last
unless we feel in ourselves that it is true and true of us What a great burden of guilt men have
Samuel said to Adam And you have tried to take it all
Lee said So do I so does everyone We gather our arms full of guilt as though it were precious
stuff It must be that we want it that way
Aron broke in It makes me feel better not worse
How do you mean Samuel asked
Well every little boy thinks he invented sin Virtue we think we learn because we are told about
it But sin is our own designing
Yes I see But how does this story make it better
Because Adam said excitedly we are descended from this This is our father Some of our
guilt is absorbed in our ancestry What chance did we have We are the children of our father It
means we arent the first Its an excuse and there arent enough excuses in the world
Not convincing ones anyway said Lee Else we would long ago have wiped out guilt and the
world would not be filled with sad punished people
Samuel said But do you think of another frame to this picture Excuse or not we are snapped
back to our ancestry We have guilt
Adam said I remember being a little outraged at God Both Cain and Abel gave what they had
and God accepted Abel and rejected Cain I never thought that was a just thing I never
understood it Do you
Maybe we think out of a different background said Lee I remember that this story was
written by and for a shepherd people They were not farmers Wouldnt the god of shepherds find
a fat lamb more valuable than a sheaf of barley A sacrifice must be the best and most valuable
Yes I can see that said Samuel And Lee let me caution you about bringing your Oriental
reasoning to Lizas attention
Adam was excited Yes but why did God condemn Cain Thats an injustice
Samuel said Theres an advantage to listening to the words God did not condemn Cain at all
Even God can have a preference cant he Lets suppose God liked lamb better than vegetables I
think I do myself Cain brought him a bunch of carrots maybe And God said I dont like this
Try again Bring me something I like and Ill set you up alongside your brother But Cain got
mad His feelings were hurt And when a mans feelings are hurt he wants to strike at something
and Abel was in the way of his anger
Lee said St Paul says to the Hebrews that Abel had faith
Theres no reference to it in Genesis Samuel said No faith or lack of faith Only a hint of
Cains temper
Lee asked How does Mrs Hamilton feel about the paradoxes of the Bible
Why she does not feel anything because she does not admit they are there
But
Hush man Ask her And youll come out of it older but not less confused
Adam said You two have studied this I only got it through my skin and not much of it stuck
Then Cain was driven out for murder
Thats rightfor murder
And God branded him
Did you listen Cain bore the mark not to destroy him but to save him And theres a curse
called down on any man who shall kill him It was a preserving mark
Adam said I cant get over a feeling that Cain got the dirty end of the stick
Maybe he did said Samuel But Cain lived and had children and Abel lives only in the story
We are Cains children And isnt it strange that three grown men here in a century so many
thousands of years away discuss this crime as though it happened in King City yesterday and
hadnt come up for trial
One of the twins awakened and yawned and looked at Lee and went to sleep again
Lee said Remember Mr Hamilton I told you I was trying to translate some old Chinese poetry
into English No dont worry I wont read it Doing it I found some of the old things as fresh
and clear as this morning And I wondered why And of course people are interested only in
themselves If a story is not about the hearer he will not listen And I here make a rulea great
and lasting story is about everyone or it will not last The strange and foreign is not interesting
only the deeply personal and familiar
Samuel said Apply that to the CainAbel story
And Adam said I didnt kill my brother Suddenly he stopped and his mind went reeling
back in time
I think I can Lee answered Samuel I think this is the bestknown story in the world because it
is everybodys story I think it is the symbol story of the human soul Im feeling my way now
dont jump on me if Im not clear The greatest terror a child can have is that he is not loved and
rejection is the hell he fears I think everyone in the world to a large or small extent has felt
rejection And with rejection comes anger and with anger some kind of crime in revenge for the
rejection and with the crime guiltand there is the story of mankind I think that if rejection
could be amputated the human would not be what he is Maybe there would be fewer crazy
people I am sure in myself there would not be many jails It is all therethe start the beginning
One child refused the love he craves kicks the cat and hides his secret guilt and another steals
so that money will make him loved and a third conuers the worldand always the guilt and
revenge and more guilt The human is the only guilty animal Now wait Therefore I think this
old and terrible story is important because it is a chart of the soulthe secret rejected guilty
soul Mr Trask you said you did not kill your brother and then you remembered something I
dont want to know what it was but was it very far apart from Cain and Abel And what do you
think of my Oriental patter Mr Hamilton You know I am no more Oriental than you are
Samuel had leaned his elbows on the table and his hands covered his eyes and his forehead I
want to think he said Damn you I want to think Ill want to take this off alone where I can
pick it apart and see Maybe youve tumbled a world for me And I dont know what I can build
in my worlds place
Lee said softly Couldnt a world be built around accepted truth Couldnt some pains and
insanities be rooted out if the causes were known
I dont know damn you Youve disturbed my pretty universe Youve taken a contentious game
and made an answer of it Let me alonelet me think Your damned bitch is having pups in my
brain already Oh I wonder what my Tom will think of this Hell cradle it in the palm of his
mind Hell turn it slow in his brain like a roast of pork before the fire Adam come out now
Youve been long enough in whatever memory it was
Adam started He sighed deeply Isnt it too simple he asked Im always afraid of simple
things
It isnt simple at all said Lee Its desperately complicated But at the end theres light
Theres not going to be light long Samuel said Weve sat and let the evening come I drove
over to help name the twins and theyre not named Weve swung ourselves on a pole Lee you
better keep your complications out of the machinery of the setup churches or there might be a
Chinese with nails in his hands and feet They like complications but they like their own Ill have
to be driving home
Adam said desperately Name me some names
From the Bible
From anyplace
Well lets see Of all the people who started out of Egypt only two came to the Promised Land
Would you like them for a symbol
Caleb and Joshua
Joshua was a soldiera general I dont like soldiering
Well Caleb was a captain
But not a general I kind of like CalebCaleb Trask
One of the twins woke up and without interval began to wail
You called his name said Samuel You dont like Joshua and Calebs named Hes the smart
onethe dark one See the other one is awake too Well Aaron Ive always liked but he didnt
make it to the Promised Land
The second boy almost joyfully began to cry
Thats good enough said Adam
Suddenly Samuel laughed In two minutes he said and after a waterfall of words Caleb and
Aaronnow you are people and you have joined the fraternity and you have the right to be
damned
Lee took the boys up under his arms Have you got them straight he asked
Of course said Adam That one is Caleb and you are Aaron
Lee lugged the yelling twins toward the house in the dusk
Yesterday I couldnt tell them apart said Adam Aaron and Caleb
Thank the good Lord we had produce from our patient thought Samuel said Liza would have
preferred Joshua She loves the crashing walls of Jericho But she likes Aaron too so I guess its
all right Ill go and hitch up my rig
Adam walked to the shed with him Im glad you came he said Theres a weight off me
Samuel slipped the bit in Doxologys reluctant mouth set the brow band and buckled the
throatlatch Maybe youll now be thinking of the garden in the flat land he said I can see it
there the way you planned it
Adam was long in answering At last he said I think that kind of energy is gone out of me I
cant feel the pull of it I have money enough to live I never wanted it for myself I have no one
to show a garden to
Samuel wheeled on him and his eyes were filled with tears Dont think it will ever die he
cried Dont expect it Are you better than other men I tell you it wont ever die until you do
He stood panting for a moment and then he climbed into the rig and whipped Doxology and he
drove away his shoulders hunched without saying goodby
The Hamiltons were strange highstrung people and some of them were tuned too high and they
snapped This happens often in the world
Of all his daughters Una was Samuels greatest joy Even as a little girl she hungered for learning
as a child does for cookies in the late afternoon Una and her father had a conspiracy about
learningsecret books were borrowed and read and their secrets communicated privately
Of all the children Una had the least humor She met and married an intense dark mana man
whose fingers were stained with chemicals mostly silver nitrate He was one of those men who
live in poverty so that their lines of uestioning may continue His uestion was about
photography He believed that the exterior world could be transferred to papernot in the ghost
shadings of black and white but in the colors the human eye perceives
His name was Anderson and he had little gift for communication Like most technicians he had a
terror and a contempt for speculation The inductive leap was not for him He dug a step and
pulled himself up one single step the way a man climbs the last shoulder of a mountain He had
great contempt born of fear for the Hamiltons for they all half believed they had wingsand
they got some bad falls that way
Anderson never fell never slipped back never flew His steps moved slowly slowly upward and
in the end it is said he found what he wantedcolor film He married Una perhaps because she
had little humor and this reassured him And because her family frightened and embarrassed
him he took her away to the north and it was black and lost where he wentsomewhere on the
borders of Oregon He must have lived a very primitive life with his bottles and papers
Una wrote bleak letters without joy but also without selfpity She was well and she hoped her
family was well Her husband was near to his discovery
And then she died and her body was shipped home
I never knew Una She was dead before I remember but George Hamilton told me about it many
years later and his eyes filled with tears and his voice croaked in the telling
Una was not a beautiful girl like Mollie he said But she had the loveliest hands and feet Her
ankles were as slender as grass and she moved like grass Her fingers were long and the nails
narrow and shaped like almonds And Una had lovely skin too translucent even glowing
She didnt laugh and play like the rest of us There was something set apart about her She
seemed always to be listening When she was reading her face would be like the face of one
listening to music And when we asked her any uestion why she gave the answer if she knew it
not pointed up and full of color and maybes and itmightbes the way the rest of us would
We were always full of bull There was some pure simple thing in Una George said
And then they brought her home Her nails were broken to the uick and her fingers cracked and
all worn out And her poor dear feet George could not go on for a while and then he said
with the fierceness of a man trying to control himself Her feet were broken and gravelcut and
briarcut Her dear feet had not worn shoes for a long time And her skin was rough as rawhide
We think it was an accident he said So many chemicals around We think it was
But Samuel thought and mourned in the thought that the accident was pain and despair
Unas death struck Samuel like a silent earthuake He said no brave and reassuring words he
simply sat alone and rocked himself He felt that it was his neglect had done it
And now his tissue which had fought joyously against time gave up a little His young skin
turned old his clear eyes dulled and a little stoop came to his great shoulders Liza with her
acceptance could take care of tragedy she had no real hope this side of Heaven But Samuel had
put up a laughing wall against natural laws and Unas death breached his battlements He
became an old man
His other children were doing well George was in the insurance business Will was getting rich
Joe had gone east and was helping to invent a new profession called advertising Joes very faults
were virtues in this field He found that he could communicate his material daydreamingand
properly applied that is all advertising is Joe was a big man in a new field
The girls were married all except Dessie and she had a successful dressmaking business in
Salinas Only Tom had never got started
Samuel told Adam Trask that Tom was arguing with greatness And the father watched his son
and could feel the drive and the fear the advance and the retreat because he could feel it in
Tom did not have his fathers lyric softness or his gay good looks But you could feel Tom when
you came near to himyou could feel strength and warmth and an iron integrity And under all
of this was a shrinkinga shy shrinking He could be as gay as his father and suddenly in the
middle it would be cut the way you would cut a violin string and you could watch Tom go
whirling into darkness
He was a darkfaced man his skin perhaps from sun was a black red as though some Norse or
perhaps Vandal blood was perpetuated in him His hair and beard and mustache were dark red
too and his eyes gleamed startlingly blue against his coloring He was powerful heavy of
shoulders and arm but his hips were slim He could lift and run and hike and ride with anyone
but he had no sense of competition whatever Will and George were gamblers and often tried to
entice their brother into the joys and sorrows of venture
Tom said Ive tried and it just seems tiresome Ive thought why this must be I get no great
triumph when I win and no tragedy when I lose Without these it is meaningless It is not a way to
make money that we know and unless it can simulate birth and death joy and sorrow it seems
at least to meit feelsit doesnt feel at all I would do it if I felt anythinggood or bad
Will did not understand this His whole life was competitive and he lived by one kind of
gambling or another He loved Tom and he tried to give him the things he himself found pleasant
He took him into business and tried to inoculate him with the joys of buying and selling of
outwitting other men of judging them for a bluff of living by maneuver
Always Tom came back to the ranch puzzled not critical but feeling that somewhere he had lost
track He felt that he should take joy in the manpleasures of contest but he could not pretend to
himself that he did
Samuel had said that Tom always took too much on his plate whether it was beans or women
And Samuel was wise but I think he knew only one side of Tom Maybe Tom opened up a little
more for children What I set down about him will be the result of memory plus what I know to
be true plus conjecture built on the combination Who knows whether it will be correct
We lived in Salinas and we knew when Tom had arrivedI think he always arrived at night
because under our pillows Marys and mine there would be packages of gum And gum was
valuable in those days just as a nickel was valuable There were months when he did not come
but every morning as soon as we awakened we put our hands under our pillows to see And I still
do it and it has been many years since there has been gum there
My sister Mary did not want to be a girl It was a misfortune she could not get used to She was
an athlete a marble player a pitcher of oneocat and the trappings of a girl inhibited her Of
course this was long before the compensations for being a girl were apparent to her
Just as we knew that somewhere on our bodies probably under the arm there was a button which
if pressed just right would permit us to fly so Mary had worked out a magic for herself to change
her over into the tough little boy she wanted to be If she went to sleep in a magical position
knees crooked just right head at a magical angle fingers all crossed one over the other in the
morning she would be a boy Every night she tried to find exactly the right combination but she
never could I used to help her cross her fingers like shiplap
She was despairing of ever getting it right when one morning there was gum under the pillow
We each peeled a stick and solemnly chewed it it was Beemans peppermint and nothing so
delicious has been made since
Mary was pulling on her long black ribbed stockings when she said with great relief Of course
Of course what I asked
Uncle Tom she said and chewed her gum with great snapping sounds
Uncle Tom what I demanded
Hell know how to get to be a boy
There it wasjust as simple as that I wondered why I hadnt thought of it myself
Mother was in the kitchen overseeing a new little Danish girl who worked for us We had a series
of girls Newcome Danish farm families put their daughters out to service with American
families and they learned not only English but American cooking and table setting and manners
and all the little niceties of high life in Salinas At the end of a couple of years of this at twelve
dollars a month the girls were highly desirable wives for American boys Not only did they have
American manners but they could still work like horses in the fields Some of the most elegant
families in Salinas today are descended from these girls
It would be flaxenhaired Mathilde in the kitchen with Mother clucking over her like a hen
We charged in Is he up
Sh said Mother He got in late You let him sleep
But the water was running in the basin of the back bedroom so we knew he was up We crouched
like cats at his door waiting for him to emerge
There was always a little diffidence between us at first I think Uncle Tom was as shy as we were
I think he wanted to come running out and toss us in the air but instead we were all formal
Thank you for the gum Uncle Tom
Im glad you liked it
Do you think well have an oyster loaf late at night while youre here
Well certainly try if your mother will let you
We drifted into the sitting room and sat down Mothers voice called from the kitchen
Children you let him alone
Theyre all right Ollie he called back
We sat in a triangle in the living room Toms face was so dark and his eyes so blue He wore
good clothes but he never seemed well dressed In this he was very different from his father His
red mustache was never neat and his hair would not lie down and his hands were hard from work
Mary said Uncle Tom how do you get to be a boy
How Why Mary youre just born a boy
No thats not what I mean How do I get to be a boy
Tom studied her gravely You he asked
Her words poured out I dont want to be a girl Uncle Tom I want to be a boy A girls all
kissing and dolls I dont want to be a girl I dont want to Tears of anger welled up in Marys
eyes
Tom looked down at his hands and picked at a loose piece of callus with a broken nail He
wanted to say something beautiful I think He wished for words like his fathers words sweet
winged words cooing and lovely I wouldnt like you to be a boy he said
I like you as a girl
An idol was crashing in Marys temple You mean you like girls
Yes Mary I like girls very much
A look of distaste crossed Marys face If it were true Tom was a fool She put on her dontgive
meanyofthatcrap tone All right she said but how do I go about being a boy
Tom had a good ear He knew he was reeling down in Marys estimation and he wanted her to
love him and to admire him At the same time there was a fine steel wire of truthfulness in him
that cut off the heads of fasttraveling lies He looked at Marys hair so light that it was almost
white and braided tight to be out of the way and dirty at the end of the braid for Mary wiped her
hands on her braid before she made a difficult marble shot Tom studied her cold and hostile
I dont think you really want to change
I do
Tom was wrongshe really did
Well he said you cant And someday youll be glad
I wont be glad said Mary and she turned to me and said with frigid contempt He doesnt
know
Tom winced and I shivered at the immensity of her criminal charge Mary was braver and more
ruthless than most Thats why she won every marble in Salinas
Tom said uneasily If your mother says its all right Ill order the oyster loaf this morning and
pick it up tonight
I dont like oyster loaves said Mary and stalked to our bedroom and slammed the door
Tom looked ruefully after her Shes a girl all right he said
Now we were alone together and I felt that I had to heal the wound Mary had made I love
oyster loaves I said
Sure you do So does Mary
Uncle Tom dont you think theres some way for her to be a boy
No I dont he said sadly I would have told her if I had known
Shes the best pitcher in the West End
Tom sighed and looked down at his hands again and I could see his failure on him and I was
sorry for him aching sorry I brought out my hollowed cork with pins stuck down to make bars
Would you like to have my fly cage Uncle Tom
Oh he was a great gentleman Do you want me to have it
Yes You see you pull up a pin to get the fly in and then he sits in there and buzzes
Id like to have it very much Thank you John
He worked all day with a sharp tiny pocketknife on a small block of wood and when we came
home from school he had carved a little face The eyes and ears and lips were movable and little
perches connected them with the inside of the hollow head At the bottom of the neck there was a
hole closed by a cork And this was very wonderful You caught a fly and eased him through the
hole and set the cork And suddenly the head became alive The eyes moved and the lips talked
and the ears wiggled as the frantic fly crawled over the little perches Even Mary forgave him a
little but she never really trusted him until after she was glad she was a girl and then it was too
late He gave the head not to me but to us We still have it put away somewhere and it still works
Sometimes Tom took me fishing We started before the sun came up and drove in the rig straight
toward Fremonts Peak and as we neared the mountains the stars would pale out and the light
would rise to blacken the mountains I can remember riding and pressing my ear and cheek
against Toms coat And I can remember that his arm would rest lightly over my shoulders and
his hand pat my arm occasionally Finally we would pull up under an oak tree and take the horse
out of the shafts water him at the stream side and halter him to the back of the rig
I dont remember that Tom talked Now that I think of it I cant remember the sound of his voice
or the kind of words he used I can remember both about my grandfather but when I think of
Tom it is a memory of a kind of warm silence Maybe he didnt talk at all Tom had beautiful
tackle and made his own flies But he didnt seem to care whether we caught trout or not He
needed not to triumph over animals
I remember the fivefingered ferns growing under the little waterfalls bobbing their green fingers
as the droplets struck them And I remember the smells of the hills wild azalea and a very
distant skunk and the sweet cloy of lupin and horse sweat on harness I remember the sweeping
lovely dance of high buzzards against the sky and Tom looking long up at them but I cant
remember that he ever said anything about them I remember holding the bight of a line while
Tom drove pegs and braided a splice I remember the smell of crushed ferns in the creel and the
delicate sweet odor of fresh damp rainbow trout lying so prettily on the green bed And finally I
can remember coming back to the rig and pouring rolled barley into the leather feedbag and
buckling it over the horses head behind the ears And I have no sound of his voice or words in
my ear he is dark and silent and hugely warm in my memory
Tom felt his darkness His father was beautiful and clever his mother was short and
mathematically sure Each of his brothers and sisters had looks or gifts or fortune Tom loved all
of them passionately but he felt heavy and earthbound He climbed ecstatic mountains and
floundered in the rocky darkness between the peaks He had spurts of bravery but they were
bracketed in battens of cowardice
Samuel said that Tom was uavering over greatness trying to decide whether he could take the
cold responsibility Samuel knew his sons uality and felt the potential of violence and it
frightened him for Samuel had no violenceeven when he hit Adam Trask with his fist he had
no violence And the books that came into the house some of them secretlywell Samuel rode
lightly on top of a book and he balanced happily among ideas the way a man rides white rapids in
a canoe But Tom got into a book crawled and groveled between the covers tunneled like a mole
among the thoughts and came up with the book all over his face and hands
Violence and shynessToms loins needed women and at the same time he did not think himself
worthy of a woman For long periods he would welter in a howling celibacy and then he would
take a train to San Francisco and roll and wallow in women and then he would come silently
back to the ranch feeling weak and unfulfilled and unworthy and he would punish himself with
work would plow and plant unprofitable land would cut tough oakwood until his back was
breaking and his arms were weary rags
It is probable that his father stood between Tom and the sun and Samuels shadow fell on him
Tom wrote secret poetry and in those days it was only sensible to keep it secret The poets were
pale emasculates and Western men held them in contempt Poetry was a symptom of weakness
of degeneracy and decay To read it was to court catcalls To write it was to be suspected and
ostracized Poetry was a secret vice and properly so No one knows whether Toms poetry was
any good or not for he showed it to only one person and before he died he burned every word
From the ashes in the stove there must have been a great deal of it
Of all his family Tom loved Dessie best She was gay Laughter lived on her doorstep
Her shop was a uniue institution in Salinas It was a womans world Here all the rules and the
fears that created the iron rules went down The door was closed to men It was a sanctuary
where women could be themselvessmelly wanton mystic conceited truthful and interested
The whalebone corsets came off at Dessies the sacred corsets that molded and warped woman
flesh into goddessflesh At Dessies they were women who went to the toilet and overate and
scratched and farted And from this freedom came laughter roars of laughter
Men could hear the laughter through the closed door and were properly frightened at what was
going on feeling perhaps that they were the butt of the laughter which to a large extent was true
I can see Dessie now her gold pincenez wobbling on a nose not properly bridged for pincenez
her eyes streaming with hilarious tears and her whole front constricted with muscular spasms of
laughter Her hair would come down and drift between her glasses and her eyes and the glasses
would fall off her wet nose and spin and swing at the end of their black ribbon
You had to order a dress from Dessie months in advance and you made twenty visits to her shop
before you chose material and pattern Nothing so healthy as Dessie had ever happened to
Salinas The men had their lodges their clubs their whorehouses the women nothing but the
Altar Guild and the mincing couetry of the minister until Dessie came along
And then Dessie fell in love I do not know any details of her love affairwho the man was or
what the circumstances whether it was religion or a living wife a disease or a selfishness I guess
my mother knew but it was one of those things put away in the family closet and never brought
out And if other people in Salinas knew they must have kept it a loyal town secret All I do
know is that it was a hopeless thing gray and terrible After a year of it the joy was all drained
out of Dessie and the laughter had ceased
Tom raged crazily through the hills like a lion in horrible pain In the middle of a night he
saddled and rode away not waiting for the morning train to Salinas Samuel followed him and
sent a telegram from King City to Salinas
And when in the morning Tom his face black spurred his spent horse up John Street in Salinas
the sheriff was waiting for him He disarmed Tom and put him in a cell and fed him black coffee
and brandy until Samuel came for him
Samuel did not lecture Tom He took him home and never mentioned the incident And a stillness
fell on the Hamilton place
On Thanksgiving of  the family gathered at the ranchall the children except Joe who was
in New York and Lizzie who had left the family and joined another and Una who was dead
They arrived with presents and more food than even this clan could eat They were all married
save Dessie and Tom Their children filled the Hamilton place with riot The home place flared up
noisier than it had ever been The children cried and screamed and fought The men made
many trips to the forge and came back selfconsciously wiping their mustaches
Lizas little round face grew redder and redder She organized and ordered The kitchen stove
never went out The beds were full and comforters laid on pillows on the floor were for children
Samuel dug up his old gaiety His sardonic mind glowed and his speech took on its old singing
rhythm He hung on with the talk and the singing and the memories and then suddenly and it not
midnight he tired Weariness came down on him and he went to his bed where Liza had been for
two hours He was puzzled at himself not that he had to go to bed but that he wanted to
When the mother and father were gone Will brought the whisky in from the forge and the clan
had a meeting in the kitchen with whisky passed around in roundbottomed jelly glasses The
mothers crept to the bedrooms to see that the children were covered and then came back They all
spoke softly not to disturb the children and the old people There were Tom and Dessie George
and his pretty Mamie who had been a Dempsey Mollie and William J Martin Olive and Ernest
Steinbeck Will and his Deila
They all wanted to say the same thingall ten of them Samuel was ah old man It was as
startling a discovery as the sudden seeing of a ghost Somehow they had not believed it could
happen They drank their whisky and talked softly of the new thought
His shouldersdid you see how they slump And theres no spring in his step
His toes drag a little but its not thatits in his eyes His eyes are old
He never would go to bed until last
Did you notice he forgot what he was saying right in the middle of a story
Its his skin told me Its gone wrinkled and the backs of his hands have turned transparent
He favors his right leg
Yes but thats the one the horse broke
I know but he never favored it before
They said these things in outrage This cant happen they were saying Father cant be an old
man Samuel is young as the dawnthe perpetual dawn
He might get old as midday maybe but sweet God the evening cannot come and the night
Sweet God no
It was natural that their minds leaped on and recoiled and they would not speak of that but their
minds said There cant be any world without Samuel
How could we think about anything without knowing what he thought about it
What would the spring be like or Christmas or rain There couldnt be a Christmas
Their minds shrank away from such thinking and they looked for a victimsomeone to hurt
because they were hurt They turned on Tom
You were here Youve been here all along
How did this happen When did it happen
Who did this to him
Have you by any chance done this with your craziness
And Tom could stand it because he had been with it It was Una he said hoarsely He couldnt
get over Una He told me how a man a real man had no right to let sorrow destroy him He told
me again and again how I must believe that time would take care of it He said it so often that I
knew he was losing
Why didnt you tell us Maybe we could have done something
Tom leaped up violent and cringing Goddam it What was there to tell That he was dying of
sorrow That the marrow had melted out of his bones What was there to tell You werent here
I had to look at it and see his eyes die downgoddam it Tom went out of the room and they
heard his clodhopper feet knocking on the flinty ground outside
They were ashamed Will Martin said Ill go out and bring him back
Dont do it George said uickly and the blood kin nodded Dont do it Let him alone We
know him from the insides of ourselves
In a little while Tom came back I want to apologize he said Im very sorry Maybe Im a
little drunk Father calls it jolly when I do it One night I rode homeit was a confession
and I came staggering across the yard and I fell into the rosebush and crawled up the stairs on
my hands and knees and I was sick on the floor beside my bed In the morning I tried to tell him I
was sorry and do you know what he said Why Tom you were just jolly Jolly if I did it A
drunken man didnt crawl home Just jolly
George stopped the crazy flow of talk We want to apologize to you Tom he said Why we
sounded as though we were blaming you and we didnt mean to Or maybe we did mean to And
were sorry
Will Martin said realistically Its too hard a life here Why dont we get him to sell out and
move to town He could have a long and happy life Mollie and I would like them to come and
live with us
I dont think hed do it said Will Hes stubborn as a mule and proud as a horse Hes got a
pride like brass
Olives husband Ernest said Well thered be no harm in asking him We would like to have
himor both of themwith us
Then they were silent again for the idea of not having the ranch the dry stony desert of
heartbreaking hillside and unprofitable hollow was shocking to them
Will Hamilton from instinct and training in business had become a fine reader of the less
profound impulses of men and women He said If we ask him to close up shop it will be like
asking him to close his life and he wont do it
Youre right Will George agreed He would think it was like uitting Hed feel it was a
cowardice No he will never sell out and if he did I dont think he would live a week
Will said Theres another way Maybe he could come for a visit Tom can run the ranch Its
time Father and Mother saw something of the world All kinds of things are happening It would
freshen him and then he could come back and go to work again And after a while maybe he
wouldnt have to He says himself that thing about time doing the job dynamite cant touch
Dessie brushed the hair out of her eyes I wonder if you really think hes that stupid she said
And Will said out of his experience Sometimes a man wants to be stupid if it lets him do a thing
his cleverness forbids We can try it anyway What do you all think
There was a nodding of heads in the kitchen and only Tom sat rocklike and brooding
Tom wouldnt you be willing to take over the ranch George asked
Oh thats nothing said Tom Its no trouble to run the ranch because the ranch doesnt run
never has
Then why dont you agree
Id find a reluctance to insult my father Tom said Hed know
But wheres the harm in suggesting it
Tom rubbed his ears until he forced the blood out of them and for a moment they were white I
dont forbid you he said But I cant do it
George said We could write it in a lettera kind of invitation full of jokes And when he got
tired of one of us why he could go to another Theres years of visiting among the lot of us
And that was how they left it
Tom brought Olives letter from King City and because he knew what it contained he waited
until he caught Samuel alone before he gave it to him Samuel was working in the forge and his
hands were black He took the envelope by a tiny corner and put it on the anvil and then he
scrubbed his hands in the halfbarrel of black water into which he plunged hot iron He slit the
letter open with the point of a horseshoe nail and went into the sunlight to read it Tom had the
wheels off the buckboard and was buttering the axles with yellow axle grease He watched his
father from the corners of his eyes
Samuel finished the letter and folded it and put it back in its envelope He sat down on the bench
in front of the shop and stared into space Then he opened the letter and read it again and folded it
again and put it in his blue shirt pocket Then Tom saw him stand up and walk slowly up the
eastern hill kicking at the flints on the ground
There had been a little rain and a fuzz of miserly grass had started up Halfway up the hill Samuel
suatted down and took up a handful of the harsh gravelly earth in his palm and spread it with his
forefinger flint and sandstone and bits of shining mica and a frail rootlet and a veined stone He
let it slip from his hand and brushed his palms He picked a spear of grass and set it between his
teeth and stared up the hill to the sky A gray nervous cloud was scurrying eastward searching
for trees on which to rain
Samuel stood up and sauntered down the hill He looked into the tool shed and patted the fourby
four supports He paused near Tom and spun one of the freerunning wheels of the buckboard
and he inspected Tom as though he saw him for the first time Why youre a grownup man he
Didnt you know
It was said
